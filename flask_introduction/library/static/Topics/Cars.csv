Used-Car Market Is Booming—But Not for These Vehicle","America’s used-car business is facing a mid-life crisis: dealers are selling tons of late-model cars and a lot of dinosaurs, but sales of autos in their middle years are declining.

And that’s bad news for some car salesmen. Independent dealers are showing up at auctions looking for their bread and butter: the six-year-old vehicle at a certain price point.

America’s used-car business is facing a mid-life crisis: dealers are selling tons of late-model cars and a lot of dinosaurs, but sales of autos in their middle years are declining.

And that’s bad news for some car salesmen. Independent dealers are showing up at auctions looking for their bread and butter: the six-year-old vehicle at a certain price point.

“The problem is there are none,” said Jonathan Smoke, chief economist at Cox Automotive, which owns Kelley Blue Book, Manheim auctions and other brands.

Overall, the used car business is booming with sales having grown by almost 3.4 million units since 2014, Smoke said. However, almost all of the growth has occurred at the ends of the spectrum, with sales of vehicles under four years old up by 2.6 million units over the four years and sales of vehicles 17 years and older up by 1.7 million units, he said.

Meanwhile, sales of vehicles ages five-to-eight years and nine-to-12 are each down by about 700,000 units. Chalk the weak sales up to the Great Recession, Smoke said. A slow-down in production of new cars during the recession and the years afterward left a hole in the supply of mid-life cars. Franchise new car dealers are generally faring OK, Smoke said, because they have access to newer used cars.

There are more than 25 million more vehicles four years of age and under than vehicles that are five to eight, according to Smoke. That’s made growth difficult for independent dealers who traditionally specialize in mid-life cars, he said.

These Companies Think the Next Big Thing Is Very Tiny Cars
Startups and established automakers are launching three-wheeled vehicles and other minimalist designs.","Relative to a conventional sedan, an Arcimoto vehicle lacks: one wheel, two doors, three seats, a heater, an air conditioner, a trunk, a combustion engine and scads of air bags and cup holders. Of course, minimalism is the point of creating a vehicle that needs less parking space, requires smaller driving lanes and doesn’t directly emit carbon dioxide. 

For those who subscribe to a less-is-more aesthetic, this electric vehicle may be a high point of auto design. It’s going to become either a prophecy of the weirder future of urban transportation or an anemic, goofy-looking golf cart looked back on as a joke.

Arcimoto Inc. Chief Executive Officer Mark Frohnmayer, an engineer who made his fortune in video games, is betting that the cars of tomorrow won’t always resemble those of the present. “To me, this is the sweet spot between the motorcycle and the car,” he said. “It’s perfect for 85 percent of our daily trips—going to get coffee, going to work, going to the gym, you name it.”

You might not want to own an Arcimoto—that’s OK by Frohnmayer—but the idea is that you might not need to. The concept of owning a vehicle is quickly starting to look passé as ride-hailing and car-sharing fleets expand. Arcimoto and its ilk of differently designed cars invite us to imagine that this trend will continue to free drivers from the pressure of finding one vehicle that can do it all. Instead, the theory goes, we might choose a car to fit the mission of the day. And maybe that car will need to be just big enough to complete a short trip.

A shift in ownership patterns could bring about a step change in automotive evolution that opens space for odd critters like the Arcimoto. Biologists call this punctuated equilibrium: Everything in an ecosystem seems pretty much the same for quite a while, and then suddenly there’s a new species.

In the case of the tiny, squirrel-like cars, there are a few popping up. A crowd of engineers has rolled out itty-bitty designs at other startups, motorcycle makers and even the skunkworks of automotive giants Renault SA and Toyota Motor Corp. U.S. drivers are deep in the grip of SUV fever at the moment, but that doesn’t mean there won’t be a role for these minimalist cars.",576

That $325,000 Rolls-Royce Cullinan SUV Should Be Taken Off-Road
Get your Grey Poupon and hit the mountains.","Cullinan is the name of the largest rough diamond ever found. Weighing 3,106 carats—the size of a grapefruit—it emerged from the Premier No. 2 mine in Cullinan, South Africa, in 1905. It traveled by mail to London in a brown-paper-covered biscuit box—resurfacing later that year in more manageable pieces. Those bits ended up ensconced in a place of suitable prominence: among Edward VII’s crown jewels, now Queen Elizabeth II’s.

Cullinan is also the name of another behemoth polished to brilliance in the British realm: the first-ever SUV from Rolls-Royce Plc.

The $325,000 V-12 563-horsepower beast has all the trappings of luxury you’d expect from a rig of this price and heritage. First, you’ll encounter the doors—the back seat is rear-hinged, suicide-style—that open with the push of a button. They reveal an expansive interior sheathed in open-pore santo palisander wood and carpeted with inch-thick lambswool. The cabin is eerily quiet: With double-thick glass and sound-canceling, foam-filled tires underneath, the only thing you hear with the radio off is the turn signal’s soft click.

You’d never expect them in another car, but here, meter-long door-mounted umbrellas, a hidden Champagne chiller, and back-seat workstations with folding tables and 12.5-inch touchscreens are taken for granted. The rear splits open automatically into a tailgate, allowing for the lowest loading level of a full-size SUV on the market. And that luggage space—big enough to fit an elk—is separated from the main cabin to minimize disturbances while your valets load the bags.

The Cullinan is very much a Rolls, in short, but it’s also the brand’s first vehicle with four-wheel drive; it’s meant to be taken off-road, if you can believe it. I didn’t, until I got the chance to test it during a launch event in Jackson Hole, Wyo. I was amazed to drive it over the soccer ball-sized rocks and shale-lined switchbacks of Snow King Mountain.

The Cullinan is very much a Rolls, in short, but it’s also the brand’s first vehicle with four-wheel drive; it’s meant to be taken off-road, if you can believe it. I didn’t, until I got the chance to test it during a launch event in Jackson Hole, Wyo. I was amazed to drive it over the soccer ball-sized rocks and shale-lined switchbacks of Snow King Mountain.

In fact, much of the promotion of the Cullinan has focused on proving its rugged virtues, since the brand’s credentials are already proven in the flat-and-paved-road domain. Rolls-Royce Chief Executive Officer Torsten Müller-Otvös says it must be so. “We must demonstrate that we are the Rolls-Royce of SUVs,” he said in Jackson Hole. (He also said the brand will never do a hybrid.)

It’s a surreal feeling to find oneself staring through the raised wings of the Spirit of Ecstasy hood ornament at giant shards of granite on a double-black-diamond ski run laid bare in October grimness. But the car’s automatic hill-descent control requires no gas or braking at all. The Cullinan is as surefooted as a mule and as capable as a Mack truck—and it has a ground clearance of 10 inches. (The driving position sits as high as any comparable rig you might pass on the highway, too.) A new suspension system means the Cullinan doesn’t have the jerky feedback through the steering wheel and chassis so common to most off-road SUVs. Coupled with the utter silence of the interior, the car felt as placid on the mountain as a ride up the nearby chairlift.

Weighing more than 6,000 pounds, with a not-entirely popular tankish body and a chrome grille about a mile high, it’s an easy target for those who’d recoil from such an obvious status symbol. But this is a vehicle that carries real off-road genes—T.E. Lawrence crossed the Arabian desert in an armored Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost in 1919. And the company says its core customers have vociferously clamored for something like the Cullinan for years. Rolls-Royce will make fewer than 800 of them, but all indicators say it will become the brand’s best-selling (and most self-driven) vehicle after deliveries start this holiday season.

Car,Self-driving and electric vehicles,https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2018/11/26/18113110/general-motors-electric-vehicles-self-driving-cars-layoffs,"General Motors is cutting 14,000 jobs and focusing on self-driving and electric vehicles
“Resources allocated to electric and autonomous vehicle programs will double in the next two years.”","General Motors announced on Monday that it will lay off 15 percent of salaried workers and close five plants in the United States and Canada. The cuts will eliminate approximately 8,000 salaried workers, including 25 percent of executives, and an additional 6,000 hourly workers will either lose their jobs or be transferred, according to CNN.

The five plants that will close are the Oshawa Assembly in Ontario, Lordstown Assembly in Ohio, Detroit-Hamtramck Assembly in Michigan, Baltimore Operations in White Marsh, Maryland, and Warren Transmission Operations in Warren, Michigan. GM will also close two plants outside of North America, but those locations have not yet been announced. According to Huffington Post reporter Dave Jamieson, GM has set aside $2 billion to pay for layoffs and buyouts.

The restructuring, which will reportedly save the company $6 billion by 2020, will take the company’s focus off sedans, which have increasingly fallen out of favor in comparison to SUVs and hatchbacks. The plants closing either assembled or made parts for sedans; a couple of the facilities made trucks as well, but those trucks are also made in Mexico, according to CNN. Cars being discontinued include the Chevrolet Cruze, Volt, and Impala, along with the Buick LaCrosse, Cadillac XTS, and Cadillac CT6.

GM’s shuttering of plants is also a step toward its new focus on producing electric and autonomous vehicles; its new motto is “Zero Crashes, Zero Emissions, Zero Congestion.” In 2017, the company bought Cruise Automation, a San Francisco-based driverless car company. According to a press release, “resources allocated to electric and autonomous vehicle programs will double in the next two years.”

The exportation of work on small cars, like sedans, was a concern for some economists when the new US-Mexico-Canada trade bill was signed earlier this year. According to the Washington Post, there were also concerns “that automakers might not make as many cars in North America to export to China and elsewhere overseas because costs would be higher in the USMCA region than making the vehicles in Asia.”

The types of changes GM is making are not unique in the auto industry. In April, Ford announced it would end all production of sedans in North America. Newer companies such as Alphabet, Apple, Tesla, and Uber are also in the race, trying to build the cars of the future.

Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-OH) expressed his disappointment in GM’s decision, tweeting that “Ohio taxpayers rescued GM, and it’s shameful that the company is now abandoning the Mahoning Valley and laying off workers right before the holidays.”

Sen. Rob Portman (R-OH) tweeted similar sentiments, saying, “I’m disappointed w/ how the hardworking employees have been treated throughout this process.”

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau tweeted that “GM workers have been part of the heart and soul of Oshawa for generations - and we’ll do everything we can to help the families affected by this news get back on their feet.”

Unions from Canada and the US are also displeased. The Canadian union Unifor said it would not accept GM’s decision and that GM needs to live up to the “spirit of the agreement” made during 2016 contract negotiations. The plant in Oshawa has been open for 65 years and employs about 2,500 people.

The United Autoworkers Union chimed in, saying that GM’s decision “will not go unchallenged.” In a statement, Terry Dittes, UAW vice president and director of the UAW-GM Department, said, “This callous decision by GM to reduce or cease operations in American plants, while opening or increasing production in Mexico and China plants for sales to American consumers, is, in its implementation, profoundly damaging to our American workforce.”

The president of UAW, Gary Jones, also commented that “The practice of circumventing American labor in favor of moving production to nations that tolerate wages less than half of what our American brothers and sisters make, must stop.” The five plants mentioned in GM’s announcement are supposed to be unallocated in 2019.",656
Car,Self-driving and electric vehicles,https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2018/11/9/18072678/self-driving-cars-philosophy-safety-trolley-problem-mit,"This is the most important moral question about self-driving cars
Hint: It’s not whether an autonomous car should choose to hit a person or a dog.","A self-driving car has lost control of its brakes and is heading down the road toward some pedestrians. Which one should it hit — an elderly person or a child?

For the last four years, the MIT Media Lab has been inviting visitors to answer a series of questions like these. It’s part of a project to learn more about moral decision-making. The project has been immensely popular, with more than 2 million participants from more than 200 countries.

This week, Nature published a new study that makes use of that data to understand how people around the world think about hard moral tradeoffs. The study, called “The Moral Machine Experiment,” mines the data to understand when human preferences around questions like these are universal, and when those preferences are culturally specific.

The study found that almost everyone cares about preserving more lives than fewer, but that people in individualist cultures value this more. It also found that participants in some countries care more about age, status, and whether pedestrians were crossing against the light. While there are some moral instincts that seem fairly universal, many vary across human societies.

“We wanted to collect data to identify which factors people think are important for autonomous cars to use in resolving ethical tradeoffs”, said Iyad Rahwan, one of the study authors.

Much of the coverage of the study has focused on the self-driving cars angle, and the morbidly fascinating question of how we ought to program machines to make tradeoffs like these. Nature pitched the study as the “largest ever survey of machine ethics.”

But the study doesn’t actually offer much of an insight into any questions we need to answer to deploy self-driving cars, which are mostly when and how to deploy them in the place of human drivers.

The framing of the survey questions asks us to consider a self-driving car, and some coverage of the study has suggested these are problems self-driving cars will need to be programmed to solve. They aren’t. To deploy self-driving cars, there are more profound — but also simpler — questions we need to answer.

Self-driving cars won’t use this data for moral decisions — and will likely never face scenarios like these hypotheticals
The MIT Media Lab posed questions such as this one: The car is careening towards four pedestrians, crossing the street. You can make it swerve, but this will kill the three passengers. What do you do? Other questions added complications: What if the pedestrians are doctors? What if they are pregnant women? What if they are criminals escaping a bank robbery? What if they are elderly?

Situations like the ones that MIT’s lab put in front of survey respondents don’t occur in real life, or occur so infrequently that it’d be exceptionally difficult to write rules for them. In the real world, a driver would never find herself in a situation where she is certain to kill a person if she swerves and is certain to kill a different person if they stay the course.

Thankfully, cars are vanishingly unlikely to find themselves rounding a corner to see both a baby and an elderly person lying in the street, with no time to stop, and if they do, they’re unlikely to do anything more complicated than slam on the brakes and hope for the best.

“The big worry that I have is that people reading this are going to think that this study is telling us how to implement a decision process for a self-driving car,” Benjamin Kuipers, a computer scientist at University of Michigan, told the Washington Post.

The Post’s headline itself claims “Self-driving cars will have to decide who should live and who should die.” But they largely won’t. Existing autonomous cars on the road don’t have any such programming. In general, like a human, if they see an accident coming they’ll just slam on the brakes and do their best to endanger no one.

In fact, the entire “self-driving car” setup is mostly just a novel way to bring attention to an old set of questions. What the MIT Media Lab asked survey respondents to answer was a series of variants on the classic trolley problem, a hypothetical constructed in moral philosophy to get people to think about how they weigh moral tradeoffs. The classic trolley problem asks whether you would pull a lever to move a trolley racing towards five people off-course, so instead it kills one. Variants have explored the conditions under which we’re willing to kill some people to save others.

It’s an interesting way to learn how people think when they’re forced to choose between bad options. It’s interesting that there are cultural differences. But while the data collected is descriptive of how we do make moral choices, it doesn’t answer the question of how we should. And it’s not clear that it’s of any more relevance to self-driving cars than to every other policy we consider every day — all of which involve tradeoffs that can cost lives.",837
Car,Alternatives to owning a car,https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2018/10/19/18000478/uber-lyft-all-access-ride-pass-subscription-plan,"Uber and Lyft unveiled new subscription plans. But are they really worth the money?
Two weeks after Lyft, Uber rolled out its own deal where riders pay a monthly fee for consistently lower fares.","On Tuesday, Uber rolled out Ride Pass, a subscription plan in which customers pay $14.99 monthly (or $24.99 in Los Angeles) to avoid surge pricing. The plan, which Uber is marketing as “an affordable option people can use for their everyday transportation needs,” is only available in Los Angeles, Austin, Orlando, Denver, and Miami for now. This offering comes not too long after Lyft announced its own subscription service.

Two weeks ago, Lyft unveiled their new All-Access Plan; users pay $299 per month and receive up to 30 rides — all of which must be under $15 or Lyft will charge the difference. Users will also get 5 percent off any additional rides.

Lyft has been testing variations of this plan for years, but is finally pulling the trigger because they claim this “pricing structure resonated most with passengers.” According to a press release, the All-Access Plan will run you 59 percent less than having a car, based on the 2018 Driving Costs report by AAA.

Katie Dill, Lyft’s design vice president, said this was the company’s first step toward making car ownership optional. “In the future we won’t own transportation; we’ll subscribe to it like we do Netflix or ClassPass or Amazon Prime,” she said.

Uber’s deal is more like the Amazon Prime-style model, where you pay a monthly rate to get better deals throughout that month. However, the trade might seem sweeter if price inconsistency wasn’t something Uber created to squeeze its riders in the first place.

Moving America away from its car-centric culture may be the long-term goal, but there is no doubt that this plan offers more immediate effects. Locking customers into a payment plan would theoretically keep them from toggling between Uber, Lyft, Juno, or Via to see who has the best deal. Lyft could also potentially capture additional revenue from subscribers who don’t actually use their $299 worth of rides.

According to Wired, both Lyft and Uber have been piloting versions of a subscription service since last year. Author of The Membership Economy Robbie Baxter had a chance to try out an earlier version of Lyft’s subscription program, when it was offering 30 rides for $200. That deal seemed compelling enough to get people to change their behavior, but she’s not so sure about the numbers Lyft landed on. “At $300 it’s not as good as a deal, and it requires some math,” she said. “It’s not a no-brainer.”

When moving to a subscription model, Baxter says that any company’s biggest fear is that only those who frequently use the platform will purchase it. If most of the people who sign up for the All-Access Plan are riders who already spend $299 a month, it’s not going to reap many rewards for the company. Lyft is betting on enticing customers who currently spend a little bit under that mark.

“I think they’re trying to figure this out and taking a very conservative approach,” she said. “Because they have a sense of what would happen if they made the offer very sweet.” Lyft also says it will continue to improve the plan based on customer feedback.

So let’s do the math: Uber’s plan would make sense if you were paying over $14.99 or $24.99 in surge prices per month. It also presumes that you have to take these surge-priced rides in the first place, rather than noting the price increase and just deciding on an alternative transportation method.

Lyft’s is a bit more complicated. Offering 30 rides for $300, but only if they are under $15, means that this plan would only be a smart buy if you take 30 rides more than $10 but under $15. For New Yorkers, this is a pretty steep investment. According to an Empower study, New Yorkers spend an average of $84 on Uber and $54 on Lyft per month. Same goes for Chicago where people spend $66 on Uber and $52 on Lyft per month.

But car-averse New Yorkers may not even be the target audience, as Dill says this plan is designed to move people away from owning cars. So the real question is, would it be worth it for a car owner in a driving-heavy city like LA? The same study found that those in Los Angeles spend $64 on Uber and $48 on Lyft per month and those in Houston spend $43 on Uber and $34 on Lyft — a far cry from Lyft’s proposed $299, but taking into account the cost of cars, gas, and straight-up convenience, could potentially be worth it for someone looking to replace a car altogether.

Ride-hail subscriptions may not be right for all drivers, but many believe that the subscription-based model of private cars will become popular once autonomous vehicles are widely available. Cornell University infrastructure policy program director Richard Geddes said he has speculated himself whether the two innovations would combine to become the future of driving.

“If you can hit a button and say ‘I got to go to work in 10 minutes,’” he said, “and cars would optimize the commute and come pick you up, it seems plausible and like a viable economic service.”

Baxter believes a subscription model for an autonomous fleet of vehicles is most likely the future of cars, but right now Lyft’s deal just “isn’t sweet enough.” Uber’s deal may also not be enticing enough, as the company needs to convince riders to pay for an inconvenience it created in the first place.

Baxter adds that eventually people will stop purchasing the machinery, but continue to purchase the ride. “We’ll own cars the way we own horses,” she said. “It’s a folly, it’s a fun thing, but it’s not the way we get around.”

Car,Alternatives to owning a car,https://www.forbes.com/sites/devinthorpe/2014/11/01/the-12-alternatives-to-owning-a-car-that-convinced-me-to-sell-mine/#294f244f674a,The 12 Alternatives To Owning A Car That Convinced Me To Sell Mine,"Largely for tax purposes, I began tracking the miles I drive my car rather carefully, noting the mileage at the beginning and end of each month. I was fairly shocked to note that in several months during the year, I had driven only 200 miles. I figure the car costs me about $500 per month to own, so I was paying a lot for driving a little just to keep the option to drive a lot.

That got me wondering, could I live without a car? I don’t live in Manhattan so it had never really occurred to me that I could live without a set of wheels to call my own. Plus, I quite like my car. About once a month I would comment to my wife Gail that I was glad we still have the BMW we bought when I was the CFO of a global food and beverage company and not a woefully under compensated online journalist.

After looking at the numbers, we agreed that we could save a lot of money on paper by selling the car, but we wondered if we could really do it. We decided that before we  would sell the car, we’d go a month without driving it. So, as ridiculous as it seems, we decided that on those occasions when we really needed a car to drive, we’d rent one rather than drive our own and pretend we’d rented one.

The experiment was a surprising success. In general, we found we could get places when we wanted without the car, almost always with a more environmentally friendly option.

Now, let’s be clear about something. While we don’t live in Manhattan, we may live in exactly the only spot in Salt Lake City where living without a car is virtually as convenient as owning one. What I’m saying is that most people who read this wouldn’t be able to make the switch so painlessly. We don’t judge you for driving your own car!

The list of tools we use to make this possible follows, along with some commentary and anecdotes about our experiences with each.

Amazon.com. For years, we’ve been buying almost everything we can from Amazon. We never really thought of Amazon as reducing our dependence on cars, but looking back at our month without a car, it clearly has had a big impact on the number of outings we need to make.
Walking. We definitely found ourselves walking more, especially at first. When comparing a public transit option under two miles, we discovered that sometimes it’s just faster to walk. In October, when the weather is ideal for walking, that was easy. In January or July, that will not be the case. That said, as the month progressed, we got better about optimizing other forms of transportation and didn’t experience quite so much additional walking. Note that, because we live right downtown, we can walk to many of the places—including a grocery store—that others would drive to. While we didn’t and still don’t walk miles and miles every day, we’ve been walking to many meetings and for lots of errands for the 12 years we’ve lived downtown.

Light Rail. Within 100 yards of the front door of our building is a Trax stop, our local light rail line. It is magnificent. With lines sprawling all around the valley, including a direct line to the airport from our home, it is a powerful, eco-friendly way to get around. We even live within the “Free Fare Zone” so we pay nothing to ride the train in any direction for up to a mile and we often do (we always have). This month, we used it more regularly as an alternative to our car for longer trips and found it convenient and easy. While the standard rate for a trip is $2.50, anyone can purchase a fare card that provides a discount of 20%, reducing the effective fare to $2.00. The Utah Transit Authority has said the discount will expire, but they’ve said that before and then extended the expiration date. I hope that pattern continues.
Commuter Rail. The Wasatch Front in Utah features a commuter rail system known as FrontRunner. In the spirit of full disclosure, we did not actually use FrontRunner during our month-long experiment, though we have used it in the past. We were planning to use it to visit friends in Ogden (about 50 miles north of Salt Lake City) but they canceled on us, so we didn’t go. The round trip fare from Salt Lake to Ogden is about $10 per person, cheaper than operating a car, even with two people. (The IRS would allow me to deduct about $57 for that round trip.)
Bike Share. Early in the month, I joined Salt Lake’s Green Bike sharing program. I’ve become a big fan after 30 days.  There are, I’m not kidding, three rental stands within 250 yards of our building, each in a different direction, so almost anywhere I’m headed there is a bike stand on my way. I just wave my card over the lock, pull the bike from the rack and ride. The bikes have cute and functional baskets into which I can drop my laptop and I’m on my way. I confess, now that I’ve joined and rides up to one hour are free to me, I’ve ridden them often for just a few blocks because it is faster than walking.
Buses. Yes, it is true that you meet the most interesting people on the bus. Within 30 seconds of sitting down next to one friendly fellow, he was explaining his mental illness and its associated treatments. You just don’t get that kind of conviviality when you are alone in your own car. What has surprised me, however, was my discovery that because our public transportation system is designed primarily to bring people from all over the valley to downtown Salt Lake where I live, I can take a bus to get almost anywhere I need to go. With a little planning (thanks largely to the Transit App) my travel time is relaxed and productive. Just try answering email on your laptop while you drive!
Lyft. While I could combine this discussion with the following paragraph on Uber and perhaps even with the paragraph on taxis that follows, I will address each separately as they have distinct personalities. Lyft and Uber are ride sharing programs where ordinary folk will give you a ride in their own cars when you need one. The drivers can clock in and out whenever they like. Lyft sports the most affordable rates, but the app includes a tipping function that would lead most people to conclude that tipping is expected. One great thing about Lyft and Uber is that because the passenger rates the driver on every trip, we always find the cars clean and are generally offered water and snacks, even for short rides. The cars are generally newer, but always in better condition than taxis. I confess that I haven’t sorted out all of the liability and insurance issues, yet, and that may influence future decisions. In Salt Lake, Lyft arrived earlier than Uber by about 90 days; both launched here just this year. Their presence is certainly an influence on our decision.
Uber. Uber rates are a bit higher than Lyft, but the app includes no tipping function and the website makes clear that tipping is not expected. I hate tipping. (Don’t get me wrong, I tip, but I hate it. Tipping is not customary in China and not tipping was my favorite thing about China.) Uber cars must meet stricter standards than Lyft cars, so one driver we met who had tried to become an Uber driver, was forced to drive for Lyft. Both services have prime time or surge pricing programs. For instance, on Saturday night there are more people who want a ride and in order to encourage more people to drive then, the apps calculate demand against available drivers and bump up the rates. Uber, according to one of our drivers, will bump rates up as much as five fold on a busy night. Lyft, in contrast, will only triple the rates.
Taxis. During the month, I took a taxi only once. It was, I believe, the only time I was in a less environmentally friendly mode of transportation than the one I had parked in the garage. The driver was friendly, the fare was fair (about the same as the Lyft fare for the same trip later than day). The driver allowed me to pay with a credit card, but of course, that was managed in the old fashioned swipe, sign and print a receipt mode rather than the remarkable efficiency of the Lyft and Uber apps. As much as I dislike this old school piece of the puzzle, it is important. At 6:30 AM on Sunday mornings when I am heading to my first church meeting of the day, there are no Lyft and Uber drivers out and about. They were out driving and getting paid surge pricing until 4:00 AM and are all fast asleep at 6:30. Old school taxis are still out and about looking for fares.
Car Sharing. Distinct from ride sharing, car sharing companies have cars scattered about that are available for rent by the hour (or fraction thereof). Like the bikes, the cars can be accessed quickly (or reserved well in advance) and used as long as you need them. The rate for the Enterprise Car Share car nearest us (next to the fabulously convenient Trax station and nearest bike sharing stand) is about $13 per hour with tax and modest insurance. Upgrading the liability insurance is less than $2 per hour more. For longer trips that don’t involve spending much time at a destination, this is a better deal than ride sharing. Of course, it can’t compete with public transportation, but sometimes we needed to go someplace the bus didn’t. The car share program, however, was the biggest problem we faced all month. The car nearest our home is a hybrid that doesn’t get driven enough so the battery was dead the first three times we tried to take it. On our most recent attempt, it worked as advertised, with a bit of planning, just as convenient as owning a car. The Enterprise Car Share folks extended us a $50 credit for our trouble and have begun checking in with us to be sure we’re happy with the program. We are.
Avis. Living downtown as we do, we are fortunate to have an Avis Car Rental place accessible without even going outside. So, on the occasions that our schedule calls for multiple errands or for long distance trips we can grab a rental car for the day (or longer). Anytime we'd use a car for more than four hours or so, it will be cheaper to use Avis than Enterprise Car Share. The frustration I find is in the paperwork. The 15 minute process for renting a car that somehow seems tolerable on vacation, when compared with the near instantaneous access to the car share car, makes the rental process seem woefully outmoded.
Kindness. Another thing that makes selling the car possible, is the kindness of our friends and family. We’ve tried to avoid putting other people out, after all, we can easily afford a car, we’re just choosing not to have one. That said, we did get rides from friends on at least five different occasions. Of those five trips, only one involved a friend taking us somewhere (home) that our friend wasn’t otherwise headed. That kindness to us, at least in four of the five cases, was also a kindness to the environment.

Even in our current location, we couldn’t have made this decision so easily even one year ago. The Trax line to the airport wasn’t running, Lyft and Uber weren’t operating here and the Green Bike program was running only in a limited pilot last year. Salt Lake City is completely redesigning traffic patterns right now on some streets to make bike lanes safer. Things have suddenly gelled to make it easy for us to sell the car. The social entrepreneurs who are bringing us the sharing economy are quickly changing the world.

Will the same confluence of factors make it easy or possible for you to sell one or more of your cars in the near future? Share your thoughts in the comments below.",2084
Car,Market trend,https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/11/29/business/29reuters-britain-economy-autos.html,UK Car Production Slides in October-SMMT,"LONDON — Car manufacturing in Britain dropped 9.8 percent last month compared with a year ago, hit by uncertainty around Brexit and market turbulence at home and abroad, an industry body said on Thursday.

The number of cars built in Britain fell to 140,374 in October, down 15,255 on a year ago, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said.

""The fifth consecutive month of decline for UK car manufacturing is undoubtedly concerning and, while a number of factors have been at play, there is no doubt that business and consumer uncertainty is having a significant impact,"" SMMT chief executive Mike Hawes said.

Production for the home market dropped for the fifth consecutive month in annual terms, the SMMT said, although this represents only a small chunk of the market as most cars built in Britain are exported.

Overall, the number of cars built during the first 10 months of 2018 stands at 1,312,304 units -- down 6.9 percent compared with the same period in 2017.",164
Car,Self-driving and electric vehicles,https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2018/11/29/world/asia/ap-as-china-spying-on-cars.html,"In China, Your Car Could Be Talking to the Government","SHANGHAI — When Shan Junhua bought his white Tesla Model X, he knew it was a fast, beautiful car. What he didn't know is that Tesla constantly sends information about the precise location of his car to the Chinese government.

Tesla is not alone. China has called upon all electric vehicle manufacturers in China to make the same kind of reports — potentially adding to the rich kit of surveillance tools available to the Chinese government as President Xi Jinping steps up the use of technology to track Chinese citizens.

""I didn't know this,"" said Shan. ""Tesla could have it, but why do they transmit it to the government? Because this is about privacy.""

More than 200 manufacturers, including Tesla, Volkswagen, BMW, Daimler, Ford, General Motors, Nissan, Mitsubishi and U.S.-listed electric vehicle start-up NIO, transmit position information and dozens of other data points to government-backed monitoring centers, The Associated Press has found. Generally, it happens without car owners' knowledge.

The automakers say they are merely complying with local laws, which apply only to alternative energy vehicles. Chinese officials say the data is used for analytics to improve public safety, facilitate industrial development and infrastructure planning, and to prevent fraud in subsidy programs.

But other countries that are major markets for electronic vehicles — the United States, Japan, across Europe — do not collect this kind of real-time data.

And critics say the information collected in China is beyond what is needed to meet the country's stated goals. It could be used not only to undermine foreign carmakers' competitive position, but also for surveillance — particularly in China, where there are few protections on personal privacy. Under the leadership of Xi Jinping, China has unleashed a war on dissent, marshalling big data and artificial intelligence to create a more perfect kind of policing, capable of predicting and eliminating perceived threats to the stability of the ruling Communist Party.

There is also concern about the precedent these rules set for sharing data from next-generation connected cars, which may soon transmit even more personal information.

""You're learning a lot about people's day-to-day activities and that becomes part of what I call ubiquitous surveillance, where pretty much everything that you do is being recorded and saved and potentially can be used in order to affect your life and your freedom,"" said Michael Chertoff, who served as Secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security under President George W. Bush and recently wrote a book called ""Exploding Data.""

Chertoff said global automakers should be asking themselves tough questions. ""If what you're doing is giving a government of a more authoritarian country the tools to have massive surveillance, I think then companies have to ask themselves, 'Is this really something we want to do in terms of our corporate values, even if it means otherwise forgoing that market?'""

A BIGGER BROTHER?

The Shanghai Electric Vehicle Public Data Collecting, Monitoring and Research Center sits in a grey tower in suburban Jiading district. One floor up from the cafeteria, a wall-sized screen glows with dots, each representing a single vehicle coursing along Shanghai's roads to create a massive real-time map that could reveal where people live, shop, work, and worship.

Click a dot at random, and up pops a window with a number that identifies each individual vehicle, along with its make and model, mileage and battery charge.

All told, the screen exhibits data from over 222,000 vehicles in Shanghai, the vast majority of them passenger cars.

""We can provide a lot of data from consumers to the government to help them improve policy and planning,"" said Ding Xiaohua, deputy director of the center, a non-profit that is tightly aligned with and funded by the government.

According to national specifications published in 2016, electric vehicles in China transmit data from the car's sensors back to the manufacturer. From there, automakers send at least 61 data points, including location and details about battery and engine function to local centers like the one Ding oversees in Shanghai.

Data also flows to a national monitoring center for new energy vehicles run by the Beijing Institute of Technology, which pulls information from more than 1.1 million vehicles across the country, according to the National Big Data Alliance of New Energy Vehicles. The national monitoring center declined to respond to questions.

Those numbers are about to get much bigger. Though electric vehicle sales accounted for just 2.6 percent of the total last year, policymakers have said they'd like new energy vehicles to account for 20 percent of total sales by 2025. Starting next year, all automakers in China must meet production minimums for new energy vehicles, part of Beijing's aggressive effort to reduce dependence on foreign energy sources and place itself at the forefront of a growing global industry.

The Chinese government has shown its interest in tracking vehicles.

""The government wants to know what people are up to at all times and react in the quickest way possible,"" said Maya Wang, a senior China researcher for Human Rights Watch. ""There is zero protection against state surveillance.""

""Tracking vehicles is one of the main focuses of their mass surveillance,"" she added.

Last year, authorities in Xinjiang, a restive region in western China that has become a laboratory for China's surveillance state, ordered residents to install GPS devices so their vehicles could be tracked, according to official media. This summer the Ministry of Public Security, a police agency, began to roll out a system to track vehicles using windshield radio frequency chips that can identify cars as they pass roadside reading devices.

Ding insisted that the electric vehicle monitoring program is not designed to facilitate state surveillance, though he said data could be shared with government public security organs, if a formal request is made. The center said it has not shared information with police, prosecutors or courts, but has used the data to assist a government investigation of a vehicle fire.

There is a privacy firewall built into the system. The monitoring center has each car's unique vehicle identification number, but to link that number with the personal details of the car owner, it must go through the automaker — a step it has taken in the past. Chinese law enforcement can also independently link the vehicle identification number with the car owner's personal information.

""To speak bluntly, the government doesn't need to surveil through a platform like ours,"" Ding said. He said he believed the security forces ""must have their own ways to monitor suspects,"" as other governments do.

DATA ON WHEELS

Many vehicles in the U.S., Europe and Japan transmit position information back to automakers, who feed it to car-tracking apps, maps that pinpoint nearby amenities and emergency services providers. But the data stops there. Government or law enforcement agencies would generally only be able to access personal vehicle data in the context of a specific criminal investigation and in the U.S. would typically need a court order, lawyers said.

Automakers initially resisted sharing information with the Shanghai monitoring center; then the government made transmitting data a prerequisite for getting incentives.

""The automakers consider the data a precious resource,"" said a government consultant who helped evaluate the policy and spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive issues. ""They gave you dozens of reasons why they can't give you the data. They give you dozens of excuses. Then we offer the incentives. Then they want to give us the data because it's part of their profit.""

There was concern that data pulled from electric vehicles might reveal proprietary information about, for example, how hybrids switch between gas and battery power, and eventually set automakers up for commercial competition with a Chinese government entity. As cars become more connected, carmakers are looking to tap new revenue streams built on data — a market McKinsey estimated could be worth $750 billion by 2030.

Ding said a Tesla executive came to Shanghai and grilled him about the rules. ""The first question is who are you, the second question is why you collect this data, and the third question is how to protect the privacy of the users,"" Ding said.

Tesla declined to comment.

Ding said confidentiality agreements bar the data center from sharing proprietary information.

Still, he is open about his commercial ambition. He'd like to wean the center from government funding and make money from the data, without infringing on anyone's privacy or intellectual property. ""We have done some explorations,"" he said. ""But there is still a distance from truly monetizing it.""

CHINA'S EDGE

The Chinese government's ability to grab data as it flows from cars gives its academics and policymakers an edge over competing nations. China tends to view technology development as a key competitive resource. Though global automakers have received billions in incentives and subsidies from U.S., European and Japanese governments, they are contributing data to the Chinese government that ultimately serves Beijing's strategic interests.

In 2011, the U.S. Department of Energy's Idaho National Laboratory began a nationwide study of how electric vehicle owners drive and charge their cars. Participants gave explicit written consent to allow the government laboratory to collect their data, and even then it wasn't delivered in real time, said John Smart, who leads the center's advanced vehicles group. Instead, the team got historical data on a weekly basis. Cars were assigned random numbers for the study, so owners remained anonymous.

Nothing of its kind has been done since in the U.S., Smart said.

""The cost is very high to collect data,"" he explained. ""The government hasn't felt the need to provide that money and the manufacturers making their own investments are choosing to keep the findings to themselves for proprietary reasons.""

When it was published, in 2015, the Idaho National Laboratory's study was the largest ever done. All told, bundled with some additional data, the study helped Idaho researchers analyze 21,600 electric vehicles over 158 million driving miles (254 million kilometers).

In the same amount of time it took Idaho researchers to publish their study, the Shanghai Electric Vehicle Public Data Collecting, Monitoring and Research Center began gathering real-time information from more than 222,000 vehicles and amassed over 4.7 billion miles (7.6 billion kilometers) of driving history.

""As a researcher, I think that data set could be used to answer hundreds of questions,"" Smart said. ""I have a notebook a half an inch thick full of questions.""

Global automakers stressed that they share data to comply with Chinese regulations. Nearly all have announced plans to aggressively expand their electric vehicle offerings in China, the world's largest car market.

""There are real-time monitoring systems in China where we have to deliver car data to a government system,"" Volkswagen Group China chief executive Jochem Heizmann said in an interview. He acknowledged that he could not guarantee the data would not be used for government surveillance, but stressed that Volkswagen keeps personal data, like the driver's identity, secure within its own systems.

""It includes the location of the car, yes, but not who is sitting in it,"" he said, adding that cars won't reveal any more information than smart phones already do. ""There is not a principle difference between sitting in a car and being in a shopping mall and having a smart phone with you.""

Jose Munoz, the head of Nissan's China operations, said he was unaware of the monitoring system until the AP told him, but he stressed that the automaker operated according to the law. Asked by the AP about the potential for human rights abuses and commercial conflicts posed by the data sharing, Munoz smiled and shrugged.

""At Nissan, we are extremely committed to the Chinese market,"" he said. ""We see it as the market that has the greatest opportunity to grow.""

Ford, BMW and NIO declined to comment. Mitsubishi did not respond to multiple requests for comment.

General Motors and Daimler said they transmit data in compliance with industry regulations and get consent from car buyers on how their vehicle data is collected and used.

Tesla declined to answer specific questions and instead pointed to a privacy policy buyers sign at the time of purchase, which stipulates that vehicle data can be shared ""with other third parties when required by law,"" though there was no specific mention of the government monitoring centers in the Chinese version of the policy.

Interviews with car owners suggest such disclosures aren't effective. Only one of nine electric vehicle owners was aware data from his car is fed to the government — and he said he only knew because he is an electric vehicle engineer.

""It's useless to be concerned about it,"" said Min Zeren, who owns a Tesla Model S. ""If you're concerned about it, then there's no way to live in this country.""",2146
Car,Market trend,https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2018-11-30/gm-bets-on-bigger-greener-cars-and-it-isn-t-alone,"America's Beloved SUVs Won't Always Guzzle Gas
GM gave up on sedans to go all in on light trucks and electric vehicles. What happens when pickups and crossovers plug in, too?","General Motors Co. announced this week that it will be closing factories and laying off thousands of workers as it shifts its focus to light trucks, crossovers and electric vehicles. Its current investment strategy reflects the reality of U.S. consumer preferences; its future strategy is a bet that electric cars are here to stay.

As my Bloomberg Opinion colleague Justin Fox noted earlier this week, “the U.S. vehicle market has come to be dominated by sport utility vehicles and pickups to an extent never before seen.” In an auto market that has posted flat sales for the past four years, light trucks (which include sport utility vehicles) make up more than two-thirds of total purchases.

Pickups are certainly popular in the U.S. — the Ford F150 has been the bestselling vehicle for decades — but when we dig deeper into light truck sales, we can see that trucks aren’t what they used to be. American cars are now light trucks; American light trucks are now SUVs.

Five years ago, medium- and full-size pickups were the largest group of vehicles sold within the U.S. light truck category. Since the start of 2016, though, a single class of SUVs — compact crossovers, such as the Ford Escape, Honda CR-V, Subaru Forester and Toyota RAV4 — has been bigger on its own than the entire pickup market. 

So how will an increasingly diverse field of electric vehicles intersect with Americans' growing preference for big pickups and small SUVs?

I’m in Shanghai this week, where electric vehicles with their distinctive green license plates are easy to spot. Most of them are Chinese-made; many of them are small SUVs. That China offers generous incentives to electric vehicle buyers certainly helps propel these models to market, but they also match nicely with the (not just American) preference for taller SUVs and crossovers. Jaguar already offers an electric SUV; Audi has announced one. Electric drivetrains won't find much trouble fitting into the buying preferences or driving habits of global SUV seekers.

What about pickups? This week, EV startup Rivian Automotive Inc. announced production dates for its ""electric adventure vehicles."" Its electric pickup boasts specifications you’d be hard-pressed to find in any internal combustion engine vehicle: a 0-to-60 time of three seconds; a “wading depth” of 3 feet; an 11,000-pound towing capacity. It also has uniquely electric features, such as four motors that provide independent power to each wheel.

Rivian isn’t exactly going after the entry-level Ford F150 demographic; its pickup starts at $69,000. Founder R.J. Scaringe said in an interview that he’s aiming for the “Patagonia-like brand position,” illustrated by its 400-mile range.

If Rivian, and its eventual electric pickup peers, are successful in the U.S., they’ll be growing in a flat auto market. That makes Scaringe’s goal intriguing, because it would mean eating into demand, even incrementally, from another vehicle class. The question, then, is this: Would a $69,000 electric pickup eat into the top end of the truck market or the heart of the luxury SUV market?

Thousands of Electric Vehicles Are Heading to London","Uber Technologies Inc. and Hitachi Ltd. are among companies that will flood London with 3,000 electric vehicles as part of a study aimed at overcoming a shortage of charging points blamed for holding back sales.

The biggest-ever trial involving commercial electric vans and cars also includes energy suppliers Centrica Plc and SSE Plc. It will gather data on driving habits and journeys over three years with the aim of devising the optimum network for charging points and evaluating when electricity will be most in demand.

Charging infrastructure is currently limited even in the biggest cities and the information derived from the study, to be shared across the technology and automotive industries, will help inform corporate and government investments and decision-making, the Optimise Prime consortium said Friday.

“I want to learn from this project and I think it will help our business,” Jon Lawes, managing director of vehicle-leasing firm Hitachi Capital Vehicle Solutions, said in a media briefing. “We have a responsibility to get ready for electric vehicles and make sure we have the infrastructure, know how we operate the vehicles, how we buy them, how we sell them.”

Weather Impact
The trial, which also includes electric-cabling specialist UK Power Networks, will focus on London but also span rural parts of southeast England in a bid to gauge a range of motorist behavior. Data gleaned will include miles traveled, time of use, the charge consumed, and how weather affects travel habits.


Britain was selected for the study because of its encouragement of electric vehicles, with the government saying it wants 60 percent of new car sales to be electric by 2030, versus 1.7 percent now. State energy regulator Ofgem will provide half of the 35 million pounds ($45 million) needed to fund the trial, with the partner companies stumping up the rest.

Uber, which has 65,000 drivers in the U.K., aims to be fully electric in London by 2025. Centrica, while participating chiefly as an electricity provider, has a fleet of 12,000 electric vans and 2,000 cars.

Major carmakers are spending record amounts on electric lineups to keep pace with regulation, though customers have largely remained on the fence amid concerns about range limitations and the availability of charging facilities, as well as comparatively high purchase costs.

Volkswagen AG and Tesco Plc said Thursday that they plan to build Britain’s largest vehicle-charging network spanning 2,500 bays across some 600 stores in the next three years, boosting the U.K. network by 14 percent.

Customers will be able to charge their electric and plug-in hybrid cars using a 7-kilowatt charger for free or a 50-kilowatt charger “at the market rate,” according to a joint statement from the world’s largest automaker and the supermarket chain.",451

Trump Renews Auto Tariff Threat as Trade Czar Aims at China","President Donald Trump raised the prospect of slapping a 25 percent tariff on imported cars and ordered a review of China’s retaliatory auto tariffs against the U.S. as his administration continued to scramble to respond to General Motors Co.’s announcement of plant closures this week.

In a pair of Twitter posts on Wednesday, Trump pointed to a longstanding U.S. tariff on imported pickup trucks that has helped U.S.-based automakers dominate that market. He argued that a similar import tax on cars would have prevented GM’s move to close plants in the U.S.

“The reason that the small truck business in the U.S. is such a go-to favorite is that, for many years, tariffs of 25% have been put on small trucks coming into our country. It is called the ‘chicken tax,”’ Trump said on Twitter Wednesday.

A 25 percent duty on imported light trucks was applied in the 1960s by President Lyndon Johnson in retaliation to West German tariffs on U.S. poultry. Other products were included in those American levies initially but have since been eliminated. The pickup tariff, which also applies to work vans, has remained and has been a major contributor to U.S.-automaker dominance in the domestic pickup market.

More cars would be assembled in the U.S. if the same tariff were applied on imported autos, Trump said, adding in a second tweet that “G.M. would not be closing their plants in Ohio, Michigan & Maryland.”

Later in the day U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer announced that Trump had ordered a separate review of China’s 40 percent tariff on auto imports from the U.S., 25 percentage points of which is the result of Chinese retaliation against Trump’s own tariffs on imports from China. The U.S. currently charges a 27.5 percent tax on imported cars from China.

“As the president has repeatedly noted, China’s aggressive, state-directed industrial policies are causing severe harm to U.S. workers and manufacturers,” Lighthizer said. “China’s policies are especially egregious with respect to automobile tariffs.”

Lighthizer said Trump had directed him to ""examine all available tools to equalize the tariffs applied to automobiles.”

The move comes just days before Trump is due to sit down for dinner with China’s Xi Jinping on the sidelines of a Group of 20 summit in Buenos Aires and some analysts said it appeared to be related to that. The U.S. had a trade surplus in cars with China last year. According to Kristin Dziczek of the Center for Automotive Research, the U.S. exported around 260,000 light vehicles to China in 2017 and imported about 60,000.

China said Thursday that tariffs on U.S. autos would be 15 percent if not for the trade dispute, and it called for a negotiated solution.

“Speaking to the media frequently or waving the big stick of tariffs is not helping,” foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said when asked about Lighthizer’s comments.

But it also comes as Trump is pondering broader actions on cars that threaten to hit key allies in the European Union and Japan.

Trump’s ‘Chicken Tax’ Could Lift U.S. Car Output, With Drawbacks

Trump’s administration is mulling whether to apply fresh tariffs on imported autos under national-security grounds, as it did on steel and aluminum imports this year. The main targets of such a move would be cars from the EU, Japan and South Korea.

Some administration officials have been arguing that hitting allies such as the EU and Japan with tariffs at the same time as Trump is soliciting their help in taking on China would be counter-productive. The EU and Japan, in particular, have also drawn promises from Trump that he would not proceed with the auto tariffs as long as they are engaged in trade negotiations that are due to get underway in earnest early next year.

Nafta 2.0
Meanwhile, Canada and Mexico, two other major sources of U.S. auto imports, are set to be exempted from any tariffs as a result of the new version of the North American Free Trade Agreement negotiated by Trump.

Administration officials have been putting the final touches on a report laying out the conclusions of a Commerce Department study of auto imports that has to be presented to Trump by February. Once the report is submitted formally to him, Trump would have 90 days to take action.

Automakers, dealers and suppliers have come out against any new tariffs, arguing that they would hurt even U.S.-based companies and the U.S.’s international competitiveness. GM, which attributed its move this week to changing consumer tastes and declining sales, has said that the tariffs on steel and aluminum had already cost it $1 billion in profits.

Economists are also worried about the broader consequences for what would be a major escalation in Trump’s trade wars. U.S. imports of new passenger vehicles and parts were worth more than $340 billion last year.

The International Monetary Fund warned on Wednesday that the auto tariffs represented a major risk to the global economy. If the U.S. went ahead with auto duties and its trading partners responded in kind, it would take as much as three quarters of a percentage point off of global output, which IMF economists now expect to grow 3.7 percent next year.",1510
Car,Alternatives to owning a car,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/12/technology/bird-electric-scooter-investment.html,"Bird, the Electric Scooter Start-Up, Is Said to Draw an Investment Frenzy","SAN FRANCISCO — More scooters may soon land on America’s sidewalks as the West Coast scooter war propels a rush of fund-raising.

Bird, an electric scooter start-up, is raising $300 million in new funding that would value the company at $2 billion, according to three people with knowledge of the financing, who asked not to be identified because the proceedings were confidential. The round is set to be led by Silicon Valley venture capital firm Sequoia Capital and will include other investors such as Accel Partners, the people said.

The financing would cap one of the fastest and largest start-up fund-raising frenzies in recent memory. Last month, Bird began raising $150 million at a $1 billion valuation, which quickly rocketed higher because of investor interest, according to one person. Bird, which was founded by Travis VanderZanden, a former executive at Uber and Lyft, in September, had previously raised $15 million in February and $100 million in March.

A Bird spokesman declined to comment. The new fund-raising round was reported earlier by the Financial Times and the $2 billion valuation by Axios. Bloomberg earlier reported the $150 million financing talks.

Many investors in Silicon Valley are eager to put their money into another transportation opportunity after the success of ride-hailing companies like Uber and Lyft. Electric scooters have burst onto the streets of several American cities, including San Francisco and Los Angeles. Bird is at the head of the pack, with rivals, including Spin and LimeBike, also piquing investors’ interest. Before this latest investment rush, the companies had already raised more than $250 million in venture capital in total.

Consumers can use the Bird app to find and, for a per-minute fee, ride the electric scooters, dropping them wherever their trip ends. A small ecosystem of scooter “chargers” rove the streets at night to pick up the scooters and recharge them, collecting a bounty per scooter.

The company, which is based in Venice, Calif., has bucked officials in several cities as it rolls out thousands of scooters across the country, scattering them on public sidewalks and wreaking urban havoc, causing both delight and frustration among residents.

Bird’s strategy and fund-raising bonanza are reminiscent of the days when Uber and Airbnb clashed ferociously with American cities as they fought to flood the market. The playbook is to become ubiquitous and popular with consumers overnight so that city regulators have a harder time banning the product and instead have to negotiate rules.

In an interview in April, Mr. VanderZanden said he saw his electric scooters becoming the dominant in-city transportation solution.

“We’re not going to be happy till there are more Birds than cars,” he said.",443
Car,Self-driving and electric vehicles,https://blog.marketresearch.com/6-major-automotive-industry-trends-that-may-surprise-you,6 Major Automotive Industry Trends That May Surprise You,"The automotive industry has witnessed a drastic evolution post 2016 with many important advancements in technology. The old-fashioned four-wheeled cars, which were earlier equipped with basic features, have transformed into connected cars with advanced features such as cloud computing, big data, and the Internet of Things (IoT), among others.

Technological developments have led to several innovations in the vehicles of the future. For instance, big data analytics platforms are now used to optimize various parts, giving original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) a qualitative advantage in an intensely competitive market. These technologies will not only help enhance the end-user experience but will also make a huge impact on the supply chain and change the very approach OEMs use for automobile manufacturing.

MarketsandMarkets has identified some of the key automotive industry trends for 2018 and beyond. These have been classified into automotive UBI, V2G, vehicle as HUB concept, mild hybrid, In vehicle health monitoring, and truck platooning.

1. Usage Based Insurance for Vehicles
The Internet of Things (IoT) has led to a wave of connectivity that has influenced almost every industry in the world. The global insurance industry, for example, is experiencing a profound change driven by IoT and Fintech. The IoT platform helps to connect the insurers of various sectors such as motor, property, and individual policyholder blockchain. Insurance companies are increasingly using IoT data to improve their precision in assessing risk, pricing policies, and estimating necessary reserve. The introduction of IoT has created significant opportunities in the automotive insurance sector such as usage based insurance (UBI).

Automotive usage based insurance (UBI) is a category of motor insurance that considers various factors for the calculation of the premium. These factors include the type of vehicle used, distance traveled, and the behavior of the driver among others. UBI encourages safe driving behavior that results in fewer accidents, which in turn helps insurance companies to reduce claims payout and improve the bottom line.

UBI can be further divided into types and future application

Types:

Pay-as-you-drive (PAYD)
Pay-how-you-drive (PHYD)
Manage-how-you-drive (MHYD)
Distance-based insurance
Future applications of automotive UBI:

IoT based fleet management
Semi-autonomous & autonomous car
Artificial Intelligence and HMI in transportation
UBI offers premium discounts to customers based on certain driving parameters and behaviors. UBI has reduced the claim processing cost with the help of technologies such as advanced crash notification and has improved customized insurance products for customers. Thus, the usage based car insurance will have a significant impact with the growth of connected services.

2. V2X & V2G Technology
The telematics application of automotive vehicle-to-everything technology offers intelligent traffic systems, collision avoidance, parking management systems, emergency vehicle notifications, and remote monitoring and diagnostics, among other sub-applications. It provides the vehicle with the ability to receive warnings regarding real-time traffic and alerts related to accidents or other hurdles.

There are different types of automotive connectivity which includes the use of IOT by V2V, V2I, V2X, and V2G. Vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technologies use peak load management as distributed storage devices which enable the usage of electric vehicles (EVs). The stored power can be utilized to feed the electrical system during periods of peak demand in homes and offices and in case of sudden surges in electrical load.

On the other hand, vehicle-to-everything (V2X) is a wireless technology that involves the exchange of information between a vehicle and all the entities it comes in contact with such as other vehicles, infrastructure, devices in the vicinity, the grid, and the cloud. V2X technology optimizes traffic flow, increases traffic safety, saves time, reduces emissions, and performs various functions such as intersection collision warning, obstacle detection, lane change assistance, lane departure warning, rollover warning, road departure warning, forward collision warning, rear impact warning, and safety margin for assistance vehicles. However, restraints such as a lack of cellular connectivity coverage in developing countries and additional cost burden on consumers can hinder the growth of the market.

3. Connected Vehicles and the Vehicle as Hub
Automotive technology is evolving in an unimaginable way. Continued innovation will lead to the introduction of an advanced self-driving car. While AI-based systems in the automotive applications are rare, they would become an essential component in new premium vehicles over the next decade.

Human-machine interface, advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), and autonomous vehicles are the various applications that will drive the vehicle as a hub concept. A strong IoT backup is required to connect vehicles and devices. Wi-Fi, 4G, GPS, Bluetooth, and 5G (upcoming) will play a very important role in ride hailing and mobility on demand. With the growing number of connected devices and services in a vehicle, a payment gateway will be the new approach that will enhance the user experience and will be accessible to a larger user base than today.

4. Mild Hybrid
The concept of high voltage electrical systems was discussed and developed 15 years back regarding 42V systems. Despite the potential benefits, the 42-volt system was ultimately unsuccessful, owing to the high cost of components and lack of a real driving force for development. At that time, the 42V system was primarily dictated by OEMs. However, today, the recurrence of high voltage 48V is driven by fuel economy and emission regulations. In today’s market, components are much cheaper, technology has improved considerably, and the need to reduce CO2 emissions is a substantial driver for the concept.

According to the European Commission, average CO2 emissions will be limited to 95 g/km throughout the vehicle fleet by 2020. The introduction of a real driving emission (RDE) test will further increase the difficulty of meeting emission targets. Currently, technologies such as variable valve timing, gasoline direct injection, cylinder deactivation, and downsized turbocharged engines already proliferate OEM product portfolios worldwide. Hence, switching to a 48V architecture or using it in combination with existing platforms will help automakers to meet the upcoming fuel economy and emission regulations.

5. Car Health Monitor
Currently, automotive biometric identification systems are in an initial phase of development. None of the technologies have matured enough so that they can be commercialized to a level that can be implemented in economic or mid-segment cars. Even so, these technologies are expected to grow by the end of 2022 and are expected to have significant market share by the end of 2025.

With advancements in technology, iris and facial recognition technologies are expected to gain market acceptance as well as market share. Manufacturers are trying to overcome the in-vehicle health state of drivers, for which the drivers fatigue, heart rate monitoring, and sleep deprivation is detected and notified with warning systems. The health monitoring is done with the help of sensors equipped steering and seat belts. Thus, with the integration of semiconductors, the in-vehicle health monitoring would emerge as the new trend post 2020. 

6. Truck Platooning
In truck platooning, two or more trucks drive very close behind the platoon leader at high velocity, with the next truck automatically following the leader through vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication. Platooning is an incremental step towards fully autonomous freight transport over public roads and is expected to become commercially available by 2019–2020 under the form of Driver Assistive Truck Platooning (DATP). From 2019–2020, platoon-enabled vehicles will be bought by large fleet transport companies, helping to transform the trucking industry.

Future Trends in the Automotive Industry
Thus, with technological advancements and the upcoming automotive trends, the automotive industry is shifting its focus toward platform-based services, enhanced products for electrification, and increased level of automation. These innovations will help OEMs to enhance the user experience. In addition, they will help the Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers to increase their business revenue by offering systems as well as hardware components.",1271
Car,Alternatives to owning a car,https://www.electricscooters.com/electric-scooters/motor-scooters-versus-cars/,Why Motor Scooters are Better than Cars,"Let’s preface this by saying that motor scooters aren’t always better than cars. However, by and large, we’ve found that there are very few reasons to use a car as opposed to a motor scooter and that’s why we say that generally, motor scooters are better than cars for almost every use you can imagine

Price

Let’s start with the most obvious factor – price of ownership. Buying a good car these days means dropping the neighborhood of around $25,000-$30,000 and that’s for a fairly basic model. Top of the line models can easily approach the $100,000 mark or higher for luxury models. Contrast that with the market for motor scooters where top of the line models are sold for less than $10,000 and decent motor scooters, suitable for adults to use for going to work can be had in the $1,000-$2,000 range and you see that price is simply no comparison – motor scooters win hands down.

Gas

Another thing that makes motor scooters so attractive is the high cost of gasoline. While motor scooters are of course primarily a singular conveyance (i.e. they carry just one person), most times cars also carry just one person to and from work. However, when you take out the scooter, you pay to haul along just two wheels and a small motor. When you take out the car, you pay to haul around several tons of metal and plastic together with you. This means that no matter how efficient your car may be, it can’t hold a candle to the efficiency of even the most gas guzzling motor scooters on the road today.

Traffic

How many times have you been stuck in a traffic jam only to see a few lucky people flitting by on their motor scooters and getting to work on time? Need we say more? The fact is that motor scooters route you around the traffic jams and allow you to get wherever it is that you need to get to quickly and efficiently.

Parking

The other headache that most people have when driving around in their cars is quite simply the fact that they can never seem to find parking, especially in crowded urban centers. However, when you buy a motor scooter, those problems become a thing of the past. Motor scooters can be parked pretty much everywhere since they can simply be chained to a traffic light and there is little chance of getting a ticket while parking one whereas cars constantly get tickets.

Coolness Factor

Contrary to what some people may think, motor scooters definitely have a huge coolness factor. No, the cheap electric dirt bike type motor scooter isn’t going to get you any second looks, but try driving up on Vespa motor scooters, with their Italian designs and sleek lines and you’ll see heads turning all around, whether you are a man or a woman. The fact is that you can’t get that kind of a coolness factor from most inexpensive cars, meaning that if you want to have heads turn, you need to buy one of those cool motor scooters.",517
Car,Alternatives to owning a car,https://www.wired.com/2016/01/electric-scooters-uscooter-future/,"IT'S TOO BAD ELECTRIC SCOOTERS ARE SO LAME, BECAUSE THEY MAY BE THE FUTURE","THE FIRST THING you need to know about scooters is that it's impossible to look cool riding one. When you ride one, people look at you with disdain. They shout things like, ""you're the problem!"" and ""get off the sidewalk!"" (Seriously.) They try to get in your way as much as possible. Even people on hoverboards and electric skateboards judge you. These are just facts.

The second thing you need to know about scooters is that there's a decent chance you're going to be riding one soon. It might be a fancy electric seated thing from some hip startup, but just as likely it'll be an old-school, kick-push-and-coast, Razor-style ride. Why? Because we need a way to move around that isn't inside a car.

The UN predicts the global population will hit 9.6 billion by 2050. All of that growth will come in cities—two thirds of those people will live in urban areas. We're breeding like rabbits, and packing people into ever-smaller, ever-taller, ever-more-crowded metropolitan areas, because it's not like there's more land in Manhattan or San Francisco or Beijing we're just not using.

This isn't one of those ""think of your grandchildren!"" problems. Our cities are already clogged with traffic, and filled with hideous parking garages that facilitate our planet-killing habits. Even the automakers recognize that the traditional car business—sell a car to every person with the money to buy one—is on its way out. ""If you think we’re gonna shove two cars in every car in a garage in Mumbai, you’re crazy,"" says Bill Ford, Jr.—the chairman and former CEO of the company his great-grandfather Henry founded to put two cars in every garage.

The problem with moving away from car ownership is that you give up one its biggest upsides: you can usually park exactly where you're going. Public transit, built around permanent stations, can't offer that. That's called the ""last mile"" problem: How do you get from the subway or bus stop to where you're actually going, when it's just a little too far to walk?

There are plenty of possible last-mile solutions: bike-share programs, Segway rentals, folding bikes, even skateboards. In Asia, for instance, a number of cities have experimented with people riding a variety of small, economical ""personal electric mobility devices"" to get from public transit to their destination. ""They are a low-carbon, affordable, and convenient way to bridge the first and last mile gap,"" Raymond Ong, an assistant professor at the National University of Singapore’s Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, told Eco-Business.

Electric kick scooters, goofy they may be, are a particularly good answer to the last mile problem. They're light enough to sling over your shoulder, and small enough to fold for stowing in the trunk of your Uber / Tesla / Hyperloop pod. They're easy to ride just about anywhere, require minimal physical exertion, and are relatively affordable.

For the last few weeks, I've used an electric scooter as part of my daily commute. It's called the UScooter. It costs $999, and it's coming to the United States after a successful debut in China. It's got a range of 21 miles and hits 18 mph with just a push of my right thumb—on a scooter, that feels like warp speed. Every time I ride it, I feel ridiculous. But as I zip up and down the sidewalks of San Francisco, bag slung over my shoulder at the end of a long day, I do it like the fat kid strutting in that ""haters gonna hate"" gif.

Go ahead, sneer at me from behind the wheel of your SUV. This thing I'm riding is the future. Maybe.

Ridin' Nerdy
The UScooter was born about five years ago, under another name: E-Twow. (It stands for Electric Two Wheels, and you pronounce it E-2. It makes no sense.) It's the work of Romanian engineer Sorin Sirbu and his team in Jinhua, China. Sirbu's friend Brad Ducorsky helped with the development and is now responsible for the improved, better-named Americanized version.

I am squarely the target demographic for the UScooter. Most mornings for the last few weeks, I've ridden it out of my Oakland apartment and down the street toward the BART station. I slide to a stop ten blocks later, fold it up, pick it up by the bottom, and run up the stairs to catch the train. I stash it under a seat, or stand it up on one wheel for the ride. Then I carry it up the stairs out of the San Francisco station, unfold it, and ride to work. My 50 minute commute—15 minute walk, 20 minute train, 15 minute walk—is now more like 30.

The UScooter's much easier to ride than the hugely popular hoverboard, because all you have to do is hop on and not tip over. Turns out handlebars are helpful that way. You can take it over small curbs and cracks in the sidewalk, powering through the obstacles that would launch you forward off a hoverboard. The whole thing produces no emissions, needs no fuel, and makes almost no noise.

It does have its flaws. The only throttle settings seem to be ""barely moving"" and ""land speed record,"" so you're always speeding up and slowing down and speeding up and slowing down. The worst part of the whole experience, though, is the folding mechanism. Opening it is easy enough: press down on the back tire's cover until the steering column clicks out, then pull it up until it's vertical. But to fold the scooter back up, you have to push forward on the handlebars, then press down on a tiny ridged lip with your foot until the hinge gives. I call it the Shoe Shredder, because you'll rip a sole off trying to get the thing to disconnect. The UScooter has a bad habit of trying to unfold while you carry it, too.

After a few days of riding, I got good—and a little cocky. I'd weave through pedestrians, and ride gleefully in the bike lane and among the cars. (Don't worry, I hate me, too.) I'd charge through lights about to turn red, all the while making vroom-vroom sounds in my head. Then one rainy day, I made a sharp right turn, and my back wheel didn't come with me. One nastily scraped knee later, I ride a lot more carefully.

I may not be doing sweet tricks anytime soon, but my electric scooter is an amazingly efficient way to get around. It turns 20-minute power-walks into effortless five-minute rides. It's tripled the size of my immediate vicinity—I've been riding to coffeeshops and stores I'd never patronize otherwise. When I'm not riding I can fold it up and carry it, or sling it over my shoulder to go up stairs. At 24 pounds, it's no featherweight, but as I squeeze onto the morning train, I pity the people begging strangers to move so they can fit their bike. With the 21-mile range, plus the energy recouped by a regenerative braking system, I only need to plug it in once a week, for a few hours.

It won't replace your car or help you through your 45-mile morning commute, but for the kind of nearby urban travel so many people struggle through, it's perfect.

The Cool Factor
It would be perfect, rather, except for the fact that anyone riding a scooter looks like a dweeb. Sure, scooters are practical, efficient, and useful. They've been a good idea for a long time, since well before they were even electric. But they're not cool. They've never been cool.

UScooters' Instagram page is full of beautiful women standing next to scooters, and they look ridiculous. Justin Bieber got his hands on one—he's friends with a guy who helped Ducorsky come up with the UScooters name—and even he couldn't pull it off. ""If you can park it in your cubicle or fold it into your man-purse,"" Details has warned, ""it is not something you want to be seen riding.""

Scooters aren't cool. What's cool right now is hoverboards. They're not so different from scooters—they run on electricity, are more or less light enough to pick up, and can easily fit in a closet—but hoverboards have taken off and hit a level of social acceptability that eludes scooters. It's hard to say exactly why. Maybe it's the association with kids' toys. Maybe it's that hoverboards make people think of floating and the future, and scooters are the equivalent of that game where you hit the hoop with a stick. Whatever the reason, it's undeniable.

The case for scooters gets even harder to make when you look at the price tags, which are much higher than the $200 or so you can snag a hoverboards with. Ducorsky defends the $999 price of the UScooter as the rightful cost of making a safe product (you know, one that won't catch on fire). He also notes that hoverboards are harder to ride, can't handle hills, and are much more toy than transport. Plus, even at a grand, the UScooter is one of the cheaper electric kick scooters on the market. EcoReco's M5 costs $1,250; a similar model from Go-Ped is about $1,500.

These scooters are all starting to hit American shores, all banking on the same thing: That there are lots of people looking for a faster, easier way to get to the grocery store or the subway station. They're hoping that scooters are just the right mix of powerful, portable, and useful. They're also hoping to deal with some important questions about where you can and can't legally ride an electric scooter. Ducorsky wants to sell UScooters to you and me, but he's also imagining them as a great way for pilots to get around airports, for cruise patrons to see the sights on shore, and for managers to get around factories. ""There are so many markets for this thing,"" he says. It's hard to disagree.

There are plenty of reasons these scooters are a good idea, and I almost want one myself. There's just one big problem left: scooters are lame. And if Justin Bieber can't make you cool, what can?",1694
Car,Car technology,https://www.wired.com/story/zf-external-side-airbag-crash/,PUTTING AIRBAGS OUTSIDE THE CAR COULD MAKE CRASHES WAY SAFER,"CRASH A NEW car today, and you might be surprised by how many airbags spring to your defense. Passenger cars coming off the assembly line nowadays can have 20 or more safety sacks lying in wait. They’re tucked into the steering wheel and dashboard, of course, but they also pop out of seat belts, doors, rear seats, and the ceiling. And now, they might be headed for the outside of the car.

That’s the idea behind the “external side airbag,” the work of auto industry supplier ZF. It fires out from the side of the car when a T-bone crash is imminent, in a bid to minimize the energy of the impact and better protect the car’s passengers. While the idea officially remains a concept, ZF is in talks with potential customers and could have it on production cars in just two years.

When ZF first considered the idea a few years ago, it did a study on side-impact crashes and found that reducing the intrusion of one car into the other by a bit more than an inch could seriously improve the chances for passengers to avoid serious injury or death. It creates what ZF calls a “lateral crumple zone,” which is basically a big pillow on the outside of the car. And since 40 percent of car crash deaths come from side impacts, that’s an opportunity to save a lot of lives.

“This is now possible,” says Norbert Kagerer, ZF’s engineering chief for passive safety systems. And it’s possible thanks to the recent proliferation of sensors like cameras, radars, ultrasonics, and lidars, which detect vehicles and objects in the environment. If they see something coming for them at a given speed, the car’s computer can determine if a crash is imminent and unavoidable. Today’s last-minute mitigation options include tightening the seat belts and automatically closing the windows. Some Mercedes models play a loud static sound just before impact, triggering a reflex that protects the ear against the much louder, impending crunch. The new Audi A8 will adjust its suspension so the crash hits a lower, stronger part of the vehicle.

Adding an exterior airbag to the toolkit provides several benefits. By absorbing the energy of the crash, it leaves more room for the airbags inside the car to deploy properly and work as intended. For electric cars, it can keep the brunt of the impact away from the battery, reducing the risk of a fire. And it probably helps the folks in the other car, too, though Kagerer says it’s hard to predict how much.

While the basic technology of this airbag is the same as any other—a chemical reaction fills a bag with air to turn it into a cushion—putting one on the exterior of the car required stronger material, and more of it. This airbag is meant to shield the length of the passenger compartment, and depending on the car it’s made for, measures about 6.6 feet long, 1.8 feet tall, and 1.3 feet wide. That makes for a volume of between 300 and 350 liters, about five times bigger than a typical driver airbag. That requires designing not just a new sort of bag, but a new gas generator to inflate it in the allotted time—about 15 milliseconds.

ZF’s engineers also had to find ways to build the device into the side of the vehicle without marring the exterior design. “You only want to see it when it’s being deployed,” Kagerer says. So they tucked it into the rocker panel, just below the doors. It’s heavy, too—about 13 pounds—which automakers don’t love, because more weight means less efficiency.

Of course, the truly complicated part will be properly detecting when a crash is about to happen. Fail to fire and the airbag is useless. Fire at the wrong time and you’ve got a right mess to clean up. If ZF gets it right, though, when that scary kind of crash does happen, its new exterior pillow could soften the blow, and save lives doing it.",669
Car,Luxurious car,https://zig.com/wired/slideshows/porsches-new-911-listens-to-the-road-to-weather-315173,PORSCHE’S NEW 911 LISTENS TO THE ROAD TO WEATHER THE WET,"IF YOU’RE LOOKING for concrete evidence of evolution, consider the Porsche 911. In the five and a half decades since the sports car debuted, it has undergone myriad changes. The basics have stayed the same—two seats, engine in back, swoopy styling—as the details change. More power, more tech, less air cooling. Last night, on the eve of the Los Angeles Auto Show, Porsche continued the process.

The new Porsche 911, dubbed the 992, will arrive on dealer lots next summer. The design is refined and modernized. The performance upgrades should meet the expectations of the model’s legions of enthusiasts. And the tech is smarter than ever, to the point where the 992 listens to the ground to help you have fun while staying safe, even in the wet.

Foremost in the mix is a modified flat-six turbocharged engine, mounted behind the rear axle as always. That's good for 443 horsepower (up 23 from the previous mill), in the Carrera S and Carrera 4S models of the car. Porsche’s engineers reshuffled its innards to improve efficiency and power delivery, with an improved injection process and new turbocharger and intercooler geometry, Porsche says. The refinements net a 0.4 second improvement in 0–60 times, at 3.5 seconds for the S model and 3.4 seconds for the all-wheel-drive 4S. If you opt for the Sport Chrono Package, you’ll shave another 0.2 seconds off those times.

The standard gearbox will be a new version of Porsche’s pavement-shredding dual-clutch, 8-speed PDK paddle-shifting marvel, but fear not, fans of manual transmissions. The automaker promises a stick will be available, though at an undisclosed date sometime after the initial release. Find enough open Autobahn and you can reach the 190 mph top speed, though 4S owners will be able to just slip past the poor saps in the S models at 191 mph.

New tech includes a “Wet Mode” that detects wet pavement via acoustic sensors in the wheel wells—as opposed to activating along with the windshield wipers or reactively sensing changes in traction—and adjusts the stability control, the rear wing position, and gearbox responsiveness to keep the car stable. It’s a more proactive pre-conditioning of the car against those hazards, which Porsche says is key given the spirited driving owners tend to favor in the lightweight sports car. This will be standard on all 911’s, as is automatic emergency braking. Optional safety extras include Night Vision Assist with a thermal imaging camera and adaptive cruise control.

In a brazen nod to modernity, the new Porsche Communication Management system (which debuted in the Panamera) comes with a nearly 11-inch central touchscreen that’s a full four-inches grander than its predecessor. That system sits amid an interior full of assortment of straight lines zipping across the dash, around the instrument clusters, and along the doors. It’s all said to be inspired by the clean lines of the 1970s vintage 911s, with recessed instruments and minimalist aesthetic.

Minimalism rules the exterior as well, with smooth curves unmolested by such design crutches as character lines and creases. The wheel housings are now wider to match the staggered 20-inch (front) and 21-inch (rear) wheels, bumping the width by 1.77 inches in the front and bringing the rear in line with the previous GTS model’s 72.91-inch width. The electric door handles sit flush with the body, but the most distinctive design element is the 3D “Porsche” brand plate below the rear light bar—right where most drivers will be looking.

Porsche says it reshaped the now all-aluminum body, but you’d be hard-pressed to notice the difference between this car and the outgoing model. Of course, performance is what really matters, and we’ll have a full review of the car by mid-January. Until then, start gathering your spare change: The 2020 911 Carrera S starts at $113,200, and the 4S at $120,600.",636
Car,Alternatives to owning a car,https://www.vox.com/2018/8/27/17676670/electric-scooter-rental-bird-lime-skip-spin-cities,"Electric scooters’ sudden invasion of American cities, explained
Turns out there’s a lot of latent demand for a quick and cheap way to get around.","Hundreds of motorized electric scooters quietly descended upon San Francisco seemingly overnight in March.

And then one day in June, they were gone.

In the months before their rapture, the scooters puzzled, infatuated, and infuriated residents. Those who dared to try them discovered a whimsical and cheap way to get around. Non-riders saw a swarm of locusts devouring precious inches of sidewalk and street, backed by companies that were the epitome of tech-bro arrogance. The city panicked, ordering that all scooters be removed.

In late August, San Francisco announced that it will give just two companies, Scoot and Skip, permits to test 625 scooters each in the city for one year. And it has become a microcosm of the promise and perils of the scooter stampede. Already, scooter companies operate in 65 cities and are vying for the top prize, New York City. Some city officials, however, are desperately trying to rein in and regulate scooters, which often appear without warning and without local input.

Without docks, scooters are cluttering sidewalks and blocking wheelchair ramps. Riders weaving through crowds or ignoring traffic rules have caused bruises and broken bones. In Santa Monica, California, it’s apparently hard to walk without tripping over a scooter:

The companies behind the scooters haven’t done themselves any favors either. Following in the tracks of aggressive ride-hailing services like Uber and Lyft, some scooter companies have adopted the notorious “ask forgiveness rather than permission” approach when setting up shop. As in San Francisco, officials in cities like St. Louis were surprised to see hundreds of scooters suddenly perched on curbs without any forewarning.

Other cities, like Seattle, are trying to keep them out until they can write rules of the road to manage them. And this being 2018, scooter companies have attempted to seed a social media backlash to the backlash.

Amid the feverish passion for and against scooters, there’s a larger reckoning taking place about rapid changes to our cities and public spaces. The scooters are forcing conversations about who is entitled to use sidewalks, streets, and curbs, and who should pay for their upkeep.

They’re also exposing transit deserts, showing who is and isn’t adequately served by the status quo, and even by newer options like bike share. That people have taken so readily to scooters shows just how much latent demand there is for a quick and cheap way to get around cities.

Electric scooters are also challenging the king of American transit, the car. Most car trips are short, and if electric scooters do end up replacing some of them, they could alleviate congestion and help the environment. But that’s a big “if.”

So whether scooters are already rolling into your city or an infestation is looming, you might be wondering how they work, how they get charged, whether they’re safe, and if they are, in fact, good. Here are some answers. Grab the handlebars and hop on.

What are scooters, and where did they come from?
The electric scooters we’re talking about here are pretty simple. Imagine an ordinary two-wheeled kick scooter, like a Razor. Now imagine that it has an electric motor. That’s pretty much it.

The key innovation with the latest batch of scooters is the rental business model: Download the app on your smartphone for a scooter company — Bird, Lime, Skip, Scoot, or Spin — and use the map to find a nearby scooter. Enter a credit card and scan a barcode to unlock the scooter. Go for a ride. Park the scooter and end the ride on the app.

Launched in 2002, the Segway rode a wave of hope and hype into the market, promising to revolutionize transportation. The device used gyroscopes to almost magically balance on two wheels, sipped electricity, steered intuitively with body movements, and whisked riders along silently at 12 miles per hour.

But it launched with a price of $4,950, making it more a luxury bauble than a commuting workhorse. It was too heavy to carry easily when the batteries ran low. It was too fast for sidewalks, too slow and vulnerable for roads. Riders towered awkwardly over pedestrians, standing stiffly with their feet together as they whirred along. It soon became associated with tech bros and elitism, and thereafter was a punchline.

Segways are still around, but the riders are tour groups, mall security, and parking enforcement. They never became cool. As Jordan Golson wrote at Wired, “the problems that sank the Segway weren’t technological. They were social.”

So it’s these problems of Segways, plus the cost, that scooter rental companies are trying to solve.

For one thing, the rental scooters insulate the rider from most of the cost of the device. At retail, they cost between $100 and $500. But you can start riding many electric scooters for $1 and then 15 cents a minute thereafter. A 2-mile ride takes about 10 minutes and costs less than $3. When you’re done, you don’t have to take it inside or even plug it in; just leave it in a public space where it doesn’t block traffic.

This business model has drastically lowered the barrier to entry for scooter riders, allowing scooter skeptics to cheaply satiate their curiosity, turning some into loyal riders. Though the hardware is more akin to a Segway, the software makes using an electric scooter just like using a dockless bike.

Most of the scooter companies are using rebadged versions of existing electric scooter models that are already for sale. But they want their own custom devices that can handle the rigors of rental. In May, Lime announced it was partnering with Segway to design its next-generation scooter. Bird also rents out Segway-designed scooters.

The proliferation of rental scooters also draws on advances in telecommunications. The scooters have GPS units and 4G data connections to track riders’ every move. And the riders all have smartphones that locate and unlock the scooters while automatically paying the fare.

Batteries are another key advance. Since the early 2000s, energy storage systems have become more powerful and less expensive. Vehicle battery prices have dropped 86 percent between 2010 and 2016. Electric scooters now travel 20 to 30 miles between charges. These batteries have also benefited other electric transportation devices like motorized skateboards and unicycles.

Investors right now are also hungry for transportation startups, which partly explains the scooter boom. From ride-hailing to self-driving cars to electric cars, billions of dollars are pouring into companies that move people around. But short trips between apartments and metro stops or leisurely rides across parks remained a vacuum until recently.

So dockless bikes and, later, electric scooters rushed in to fill the void, securing millions if not billions in financing while clawing for market share.

On the customer side, there is a cadre of riders primed to adopt electric scooters. The generation that grew up rolling around culs-de-sac on Razor scooters is now commuting in urban centers. Balancing on two wheels is already familiar to them, so an app-enabled scooter rental service that can get you to work without breaking a sweat is an appealing throwback and a flash-forward.

In sum, the combination of entrepreneurs, technology, funding, and a race to grab a toehold in major urban centers all converged earlier this year, leading to a sudden crop of scooters starting on the West Coast in March and rippling throughout the country.

Here in Washington, DC, where four scooter companies have launched, I’ve found that the scooter has many charms. A scooter can whisk me to work past stopped traffic at 15 miles per hour. It’s very convenient to park it just about anywhere.

Some scooter firms are already “unicorns” — privately held companies valued at more than $1 billion. Bird, based in Santa Monica, doubled its valuation to $2 billion in just four months. Lime, which also rents bikes, crossed the $1.1 billion valuation mark just 18 months after it launched. Skip Scooters is valued at $100 million.

Meanwhile, Uber and Lyft are themselves getting into the electric scooter game. In early September, Lyft launched 250 scooters in Denver. Uber bought Jump Bikes, an electric bike rental service, for $200 million in April.

But could there be a crash on the horizon? We’re already seeing dockless bikes piling up in scrap yards as companies fold. In China, abandoned bike-share bikes now fill vast fields outside major cities. As scooter-share companies jostle for dominance, weaker players will inevitably fold or be acquired, but it’s too early to say whether the concept as a whole will have staying power.

Who charges scooters, and how much are they paid?
Behind every scooter parked on a sidewalk, leaning on a kickstand, is a vast, invisible infrastructure network that keeps the scooters maintained, charged, and accessible.

Engineers track where the scooters are going. Support staff answer questions on the phone. Technicians whisk off damaged scooters to hidden warehouses for repair.

And as the sun sets and power meters run low, chargers for hire roam the streets, scavenging depleted scooters, plugging them in at home, and placing them back on sidewalks early the next morning. Bird scooters return to their “nest.” Lime scooters are charged by “juicers.”

“For many people, it’s a fun way to make extra money,” said Colin McMahon, who leads Lime’s juicer program.

The way it works: Potential juicers apply for the job with Lime. When approved, they get special access through the app that highlights scooters that need charging. Charging one nets a juicer between $9 and $12, depending on how low the battery is, so a juicer’s take is a function of how many scooters she picks up and how much power those scooters need. Charging the scooter requires about half a kilowatt-hour of electricity, about 5 cents’ worth of power on average.

McMahon said most juicers spend an hour or two in the evening walking or driving around making pickups and then redeploy the scooters in specific locations marked on the app. “We leverage our data to say where are the best spots for people to begin their day for commuting,” he said. He declined to share the number of juicers Lime has on its roster or the typical number of scooters charged per juicer.

Bird follows a similar model. A diverse array of people have signed up as Lime juicers and Bird hunters, but unlike driving for Uber or Lyft, there is no background check. Technically, you have to be over 18, but many high schoolers are getting into the charging game, as the Atlantic reported.

The sliding scale for charging scooters has also created some perverse incentives that ne’er-do-wells have already exploited, as Nathaniel Buckley wrote at Slate:

... it turns out the charging system is akin to a real-life Pokémon Go, albeit one rife with cheating. The app purports to tell you where nearby chargeable scooters are, but in reality that’s rarely the case. Duplicitous collectors have created a thriving ecosystem of stockpiling, hiding, and decoying that makes it well-nigh impossible to find a scooter in need of charging.

When picking up a scooter, chargers are supposed to “capture” it via a button on the app. Doing this deletes the flag so others don’t waste time scouting for that particular Bird. It also stops the clock on the reimbursement meter. The longer a scooter goes without being captured, the greater the commission Bird will pay its chargers.

According to Harry Campbell of the Rideshare Guy Blog, scooter bounty hunters can net $20 to $30 an hour. And since each scooter can only be claimed by one charger, it can get competitive, as Taylor Lorenz reported at the Atlantic:

In saturated markets, the race to quickly grab as many scooters as possible is fierce. “One time I pulled up to pick up a scooter, I got there maybe 10 seconds before the other guy did,” said one charger in San Diego. “He started yelling at me. He picked up a Bird scooter and started beating my car. I got the hell out of there.”

There are also repair crews who scoop up damaged or vandalized scooters, though scooter companies insist only a small fraction of their vehicles end up deliberately mangled.

Are electric scooters safe? Do I need a helmet?
“Speed has never killed anyone,” said former Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson. “Suddenly becoming stationary, that’s what gets you.”

This holds for scooters. Traveling at up to 15 miles per hour doesn’t seem like much until you rapidly become acquainted with an unmoving object — say, a street sign, a wall, or the ground. Scooters don’t have crumple zones, air bags, or padding, so riders are exposed to everything around them.

There has been a rise in scooter-related injuries, but that’s largely a function of the spread of scooters themselves rather than any inherent danger in the vehicle. Still, given the vast abundance of these scooters, some physicians are concerned. Law firms are also readying themselves for litigation.

“We’re seeing these injuries daily, and at least once or twice a week we’re seeing someone who needs an urgent surgery,” Natasha Trentacosta, an orthopedic surgeon in Los Angeles studying electric scooter-related injuries, told the Cedars-Sinai Blog. “These can be life-changing injuries, and they can often be prevented.”

Right now there isn’t any good data on injury rates among scooter riders. Many of the bumps and scrapes that come from a scooter tumble are minor, and there is no good way to track them. Health officials in California are trying to change that with a standardized data collection system.

There are plenty of threats to scooter riders for researchers to track. The tiny wheels can get trapped by uneven sidewalks and grates, causing falls. Damp weather can easily weaken the tires’ grip. On busy sidewalks, riders have to maneuver around pedestrians, pets, and potholes. On the road, scooters can be hard for drivers to see, and heavy, fast-moving vehicles can be deadly.

There’s also a learning curve. Electric motors can accelerate surprisingly quickly, and the momentum a rider generates takes effort to slow down. Keeping a leg ready to brace for a sudden stop requires some practice.

However, many of the same precautions for cyclists can reduce risks on scooters: Be aware of your surroundings, make sure the equipment is in good order, follow traffic rules, take your earbuds out, put away your phone, and be judicious with your speed.

As for helmets, scooter companies encourage riders to wear them with reminders in their respective apps (it’s also required by law in some states), though almost no one does. Bird currently offers free helmets to active riders (just pay shipping) but is also lobbying to relax helmet laws in California.

In practical terms, though, many riders won’t be carrying a helmet around for scootering since it’s a transportation mode designed for whim and convenience.

And the biggest safety issues right now stem from inexperience. Given how new scooters are, there’s no consistent etiquette for riding an electric scooter, and so pedestrians, drivers, and cyclists can’t necessarily anticipate what a scooter will do in an intersection, which can lead to conflicts (read: collisions).

Some riders claim the sidewalk; others ride in the street. Some will follow pedestrian signals, some will obey traffic lights, and some will do none of the above. Scooters don’t have turn signals, so it’s hard to broadcast your intent as a rider. They do have bells, but they don’t help much to get the attention of car drivers.

Establishing a set of best practices (and actually following them) would go a long way toward smoothing out the tensions between different modes of transport and solving the safety issues around scooters. This would require regulation from cities and education from scooter companies.

And as with any vehicle, don’t ride a scooter under the influence; it’s dangerous and illegal.

What’s the best place to ride a scooter: sidewalk, bike lane, or street?
Most city ordinances say (and scooter rental companies insist) that electric scooters shouldn’t be ridden on sidewalks. Motorized vehicles pose a nuisance, if not a hazard, to pedestrians.

So that pretty much leaves streets. And for the reasons mentioned above, it can be nerve-racking for riders as cars whizz by. Which means scooters often remain on sidewalks, against the terms of service and, in many cases, the law.

The best and likely safest place for a scooter is a bike lane since there are no pedestrians and because the lanes can accommodate faster traffic (as a daily bike commuter, scooters aren’t any more annoying than slower cyclists).

However, most streets don’t have bike lanes, and unless the bike lane is protected or separated from car traffic, scooter riders will still have to contend with cars weaving in and out. Bike lanes also don’t reach most destinations, which means a scooter ride will almost always require riding on the sidewalk or in open traffic at some point.

Are electric scooters good for the environment? And will they reduce car traffic?
The answer is an unsatisfactory “it depends.”

Like electric cars, scooters are only as green as the electricity that charges them. If your city gets most of its power from a coal or natural gas-fired power plant, that means your scoot around the neighborhood has a positive carbon footprint.

But the other piece of the environmental equation is what the scooter ride is displacing, or if it leads to trips that otherwise wouldn’t be taken.

For example, Estonia launched the largest free public transit system in the world in July. In the capital, Tallinn, researchers found that the scheme didn’t reduce car travel but did decrease walking.

If you’re scooting instead of walking, then the ride has a higher environmental cost. But if you’re replacing a car ride, then it has an environmental benefit since an electric scooter uses a tiny fraction of the energy consumed by a car.

Right now, scooters are doing both.

“Some of those walk trips are likely to be taken away at the shorter end, and some of those car trips are those at the long end,” said Brian Taylor, a professor of urban planning at the University of California Los Angeles who studies how transportation serves different population sets.

How does the environmental impact of scooters stack up next to public transit? Well, it also depends. The balance changes depending on how far you’re going and the form of transit it’s replacing, whether it’s a diesel bus or an electric train.

On the other hand, a scooter can also encourage the use of public transportation. Most scooter trips are 1 to 2 miles long, and the companies themselves pitch scooters as filling the “last mile” in transit, expanding the reach of a transit station or a bus stop.

“There’s the West LA rail station that’s a 22-minute walk from me,” Taylor said. “I took a scooter the other day and it took me five minutes.”

If a scooter can help avoid commuting by car altogether, then the net environmental benefits can be huge. And even added all together, the energy use of scooters is trivial compared to the ongoing energy use in cars, buses, trains.

Keep in mind that the vast majority of trips people take on a regular basis are short. According to the US Department of Energy, almost 60 percent of vehicle trips in 2017 were less than 6 miles:

And if more scooters are riding in the streets, that could slow down traffic and increase congestion.

Are electric scooters good for cities?
In a word, yes. A qualified yes.

Despite the consternation about how they’ve been rolled out, public opinion is on their side. According to a July survey by Populus of 7,000 people in a report titled “The Micro-Mobility Revolution,” 70 percent of respondents on average had a positive view of scooters, though perceptions varied by city:

The differences in attitude across cities in part come from the fact that scooter companies and their riders haven’t always been the best citizens. Many cities were eager to deploy docked bike-share bikes because it gave them control over where the bikes end up. But dockless bikes, and now scooters, have made it much more difficult to wrangle wheels.

Scooters and bikes blocked sidewalks, disability access ramps, and green spaces. For some of the launch cities, they quickly became a nuisance. For people with disabilities or limited mobility, the scooters became a hazard. For this reason, some urban planners say scooters must be regulated.

But cities that saw a more gradual rollout have had a much smoother ride.

“In San Francisco, you saw a lot of backlash,” said Sanjay Dastoor, CEO of Skip, of the sudden, unannounced scooter deployment in the city. “We didn’t see DC in the news with a scooter armageddon. The backlash depends on the way you do it.”

Dastoor noted that Skip is proactively working with cities before deploying in a market and has never been issued a cease-and-desist order. The company is also trying to encourage riders to be more considerate through its app, informing them of the rules before they ride.

However, he acknowledged it’s still a challenge to keep miscreants in check. “In terms of enforcing behavior, that’s tough to do,” he said.

Companies are also working to ensure their devices stay out of the way. Scooter companies now ask riders for a photo to verify that the scooter is parked in an appropriate spot at the end of a ride.

The upshot of all this hassle is that scooters are bringing cheap transportation to people who may otherwise not have used it. They effectively expand the range of neighborhoods, allowing residents to easily travel further and increasing the reach of businesses. Researchers have found that mobility is a critical rung in the ladder out of poverty.

That may explain why electric scooters have a better reputation with people of lower incomes, according to Populus:

Bird has already proposed offering discounts for people who live in public housing or receive food stamps. Lime introduced a donation module to its app that will allow riders to dedicate part of their fare to a local nonprofit.

Cities are starting to pick up on this. In talking with city officials, Dastoor said one of the concerns that keeps cropping up is equality: Cities want to make sure scooters serve all neighborhoods and that people have equal access to them.

Scooters could also work as a stopgap solution for transit deserts, but there are still people who can’t take advantage of them, like residents who can’t afford a smartphone to unlock one. For them, the benefit of scooters may just be that they expose gaps in transportation infrastructure.

But while cities argue over what to do about electric scooters, there’s another dockless vehicle taking up public spaces that often gets left out of the discussion:

It’s hard to overstate just how much cars have shaped cities, suburbs, and the country as a whole, becoming the water we all swim in. While cities are working to limit the number of scooters permitted, few have even thought about capping the number of cars. You even need a driver’s license to ride a scooter. As Populus observed in its report:

Based on the most recent public data, San Francisco, a relatively small city with one of the lowest vehicle ownership rates in the country, has approximately 500,000 registered vehicles. The city has approximately 442,000 publicly-available parking spots, including 275,000 on-street parking spaces. In comparison, various e-scooter regulations across the country that have adopted fleet restrictions have set caps on the number of e-scooters at 150 (on the low end) to 3,000 per company (on the high end, or no cap at all).

Though not everyone owns a car, everyone pays for one. There are roughly eight parking spots for every car in the United States, and free parking amounts to a subsidy to car owners of more than $100 billion a year.

That’s all before you include the impacts of driving, where the car actually moves. Roadways, law enforcement, pollution, and lost lives all add up to a huge social cost from driving, one that completely dwarfs anything electric scooters can muster.

And when a scooter company falls, it isn’t going to get a bailout from Congress.

This means there’s a strong case for demanding concessions from car infrastructure to facilitate walking, biking, and scooter riding — transit options that are more equitable and easier to access. That is, narrower roads in favor of larger bike lanes and sidewalks, also called a road diet. And as Alissa Walker pointed out on our sister site Curbed, where there’s a will, there’s a way:

Seville, Spain—a city almost identical in size to San Francisco—built out a comprehensive “lightning” bike-lane network in just 18 months. The number of people commuting by bike daily increased tenfold in about four years. How did it work? The city carved out space from existing roadways—and eliminated 5,000 places to park cars.

But scooter companies need to have city officials on their side if they want to continue doing business. Even scofflaws like Lyft and Uber are wising up, submitting proposals to cities like Santa Monica before launching their own scooter businesses there.

Perhaps one of the greatest benefits of scooters will be that they will force a larger discussion of whom or what we prioritize when we design cities. “I’m hoping that all of this disruption will help us think more systematically about these things,” said UCLA’s Taylor.

The Big Apple is eager to have this conversation. City officials are already crafting legislation to help target scooters to areas suffering from transit congestion, like the L train corridor. Earlier this month, the New York Times editorial board endorsed the prospect of electric scooters roaming the streets. “If the city is serious about wanting safe, reliable ways for people in all areas of New York to get around, the path ahead is clear,” they wrote.",4819
Car,Alternatives to owning a car,https://20somethingfinance.com/the-economics-of-owning-a-motor-scooter-vs-a-car/,The Economics of Owning a Motor Scooter Vs. a Car,"How Much Does it Cost to Own a Motor Scooter (Moped)?
A number of years ago, I sold one of our two cars. My wife and I were both riding the bus to and from work, and rarely both needed a vehicle on the same day. So we got rid of a car. It’s saved me over $300/month. As fate played out, not long after my wife lost her job and when she started working again, she had a 60+ mile daily commute. Needless to say, she needed a car Monday through Friday. Meanwhile, I was still busing and biking to work.

I’m happy to take the bus to and from work on a daily basis. The problem lies in that without a vehicle during the week, I have no way to get myself around to doctors appointments or anywhere else that the bus or my self-powered bike won’t take me. As a result, I need some way to get around town. I don’t want to spend the cash required to get a new vehicle when I will rarely use it, so one legit option that I’m considering is a motor scooter.

Motor Scooters are Still Cool, Right?
mopedWait. Were they ever cool? Ah, who cares. I’m married, and stopped caring about cool a few years ago. I’ve started to price these bad boys out, and it looks like you can get a relatively new used motor scooter for around $1,000 on Craigslist, fairly easily. Even if you were to get a cheapo car that you paid about $200 a month for, for 5 years, you’re looking at a payoff of about 5 months for a motor scooter, in comparison.

What Costs are Involved with a Moped?
I’m sure insurance laws vary by state, but here in Michigan, you don’t need insurance to operate one of these things. Of course, if you get in an accident, there probably won’t be much left of you to pay for any damage or lawsuits. Additionally, a scooter license is cheap. Just $5 per year (versus $60 for a car).

How About Scooter Gas Mileage?
Depends on the scooter’s engine size. But a 50cc engine will get you about 100 miles per gallon – about 5 times the average vehicle.

Total Cost Savings of a Moped Versus a Car?
Let’s say you could buy a used car for $12,000 and get a 0% 3-year loan or get a $1,000 scooter instead and pay cash. These are patchwork assumptions at best, but it should give you a rough estimate on monthly cost savings:

Insurance:

Car: $60/mo.
Scooter: $0
Gas:

Car: $60/mo.
Scooter: $20/mo.
Price:

Car: $333/mo. for three years
Scooter: $1,000 up front = 3 months of car payments, or one-twelve the price of the car.
After 3 months of ownership, you’d be paying $453/month to operate the car, and $20/month to operate the scooter. Add in maintenance costs, car washes, and more, and you can see that I’m being very generous on the cost of owning the car.

Any Downsides to Owning a Scooter?
Other than the safety risks, I can’t really think of any. If you don’t like the scooter and decide it’s not for you, you can probably sell it for about what you bought it for. Are there any downsides beyond the obvious prideful shame of being seen on a scooter?

Arrest and firing of Carlos Ghosn as Nissan’s chairman upset auto maker’s plan to promote upgrades to the Leaf line","LOS ANGELES— Nissan Motor Co. NSANY 0.46% was hoping to make a big splash with the unveiling of a longer-range Leaf electric car at the Los Angeles Auto Show this week.

It hired Hollywood actress Margot Robbie to help introduce the upgrade model and rented out space at the Japanese American National Museum for a gala event for the media.

But with news of the arrest of Nissan’s former Chairman and Chief Executive Carlos Ghosn threatening to overshadow the reveal, the company decided to postpone the Leaf’s official announcement.

The cancellation earlier this week illustrates challenges now facing Nissan executives as they try to stay focused on selling cars amid turmoil engulfing the company’s senior ranks following last week’s removal of its longtime chairman over allegations of financial misconduct.

Auto makers typically use auto-show unveilings to hype new models to the media and consumers, aiming to create a buzz before a vehicle goes on sale. The Leaf’s unexpected absence at the auto show, a choice spot for introducing electric cars and other advanced technologies, now has allowed rival auto makers to steal the spotlight.

Mr. Ghosn, who led Nissan for nearly two decades and became one of the most prominent industry executives, is in custody at a Tokyo jail on suspicions of underreporting income in Nissan’s financial reports. Although he hasn’t been formally charged, he has been detained for questioning since his arrest on Nov. 19.

Mr. Ghosn has told prosecutors he denies wrongdoing, according to Japanese public broadcaster NHK. The office of his lawyer, Motonari Otsuru, declined to comment.

The abrupt downfall of Mr. Ghosn has created uncertainty for an industrial alliance he forged tying together Nissan with partners Renault SA of France and Japan’s Mitsubishi Motors Corp. And it has left a vacuum at the top of Nissan, in terms of global strategy.

Alliance members issued a joint statement Thursday signaling their commitment to the three-company partnership. 

No one has been nominated to take over Mr. Ghosn’s spot as Nissan chairman. Hiroto Saikawa, who replaced Mr. Ghosn as Nissan chief executive in April 2017, is running the company as the only senior board member.

Executives at Nissan and junior partner Mitsubishi—where Mr. Ghosn had also served as chairman until his removal earlier this week—put on a brave face this week at the Los Angeles car show, one of the largest in the U.S., saying it is business as usual for their U.S. operations.

“We just concentrate on short-term operations and we are doing that,” Nissan U.S. chief Denis Le Vot said in an interview.

The internal upheaval comes as Nissan’s U.S. sales growth has stalled. Like other auto makers, it is confronting new threats from Silicon Valley rivals who want to upend the car business on everything from electric cars to in-car multimedia systems.

Nissan’s U.S. sales rose 1.9% last year compared with 2016 but were down 6.4% through October this year, as U.S. demand for new vehicles slows after more than a half-decade of growth.

Nissan along with other Japanese car makers has been hurt by its reliance on small cars and sedans, as more customers flock to larger sport-utility vehicles and pickup trucks.

Passenger-car sales at Nissan, including sedans like the Altima, were down nearly 17% through October. About 55% of Nissan’s 2017 U.S. sales were from trucks and SUVs compared with around 65% for the broader industry.

Mr. Le Vot, who spent his career at Renault before moving to Nissan in January, said he hadn’t spoken directly to Mr. Saikawa since Mr. Ghosn was removed as chairman. “It’s just the usual internal communications,” he said.

Mitsubishi Motors’ U.S. head, Fred Diaz, echoed those remarks and said his company is focused on day-to-day operations. Nissan took a controlling interest in Mitsubishi in 2016, and Mr. Diaz was named head of North American operations in April after five years as an executive in the U.S. with Nissan.

Mr. Diaz, when asked about his reaction to the boardroom drama, demurred. “That’s not something that I even feel remotely comfortable talking about just because I really don’t know where this is going,” he said.

At the L.A. auto show, Nissan limited its debuts to a slightly newer version of its Maxima sedan and Murano crossover. The highly anticipated upgrade of the Leaf electric vehicle lineup was noticeably absent.

Meanwhile, Hyundai Motor Co. unveiled a pair of small electric cars, and a new sport-utility vehicle and pickup truck from startup Rivian Automotive Inc. generated buzz.

“The official announcement regarding details of the 2019 Nissan Leaf with additional performance capabilities is postponed to a later date,” Nissan said in a statement. A spokesman said the company delayed the reveal “to ensure that this important product unveiling could receive the coverage it merits.”

Ms. Robbie, the actress hired by Nissan to introduce the new Leaf, went on with the show, appearing on stage Tuesday for a talk about her commitment to sustainability—but without the latest version of the Leaf.",827

Top executives in the global auto alliance meet for first board meeting since Carlos Ghosn’s arrest
","AMSTERDAM— Renault SA, RNO -0.56% Nissan Motor Co. NSANY +0.49% and Mitsubishi Motors Corp. affirmed support for their globe-spanning alliance as senior executives from the auto makers met formally for the first time since the arrest of Carlos Ghosn, the partnership’s prime architect.

In a joint statement Thursday, the three companies said their boards of directors are “fully committed” to the alliance, which Mr. Ghosn forged almost two decades ago after France’s Renault invested in its struggling Japanese rival Nissan. Mr. Ghosn, working in various senior positions at both companies, subsequently brought Mitsubishi into the fold, creating the world’s second-largest car maker by production behind Volkswagen AG.

Nissan Chief Executive Hiroto Saikawa, who participated in the meeting by teleconference, said Thursday that he and leaders at the two other companies “confirmed the importance of the alliance” and agreed to work together. “It was a really good meeting,” Mr. Saikawa said outside his home in Tokyo. “We confirmed that the three of us will work in concert.”

Thursday’s meeting, held at the offices of Renault-Nissan BV, the Dutch entity that helps manage the alliance, had been scheduled before Mr. Ghosn’s arrest—a bombshell that has exposed tensions between Renault and Nissan executives over the structure of the alliance.

After the arrest last week, Nissan and Mitsubishi ousted Mr. Ghosn from his chairmanship at each company. He remains CEO and chairman at Renault, though the French car maker has appointed executives to fill those posts in an interim basis.

Mr. Ghosn, who remains in jail, couldn’t be reached for comment, and the office of his Japanese attorney, Motonari Otsuru, declined to comment. Mr. Ghosn hasn’t been charged with a crime, and, according to Japanese broadcaster NHK, has denied wrongdoing.

Prosecutors say they suspect Mr. Ghosn understated his compensation by a total of about ¥5 billion, or $44 million, in five years of Nissan financial reports to regulators through 2015.

A Nissan internal investigation separately alleges Mr. Ghosn spent millions from an obscure Nissan fund to buy and renovate luxury homes, according to a person familiar with the matter. The Ghosn family believed the residences in question were corporate housing, whose purchase went through the normal channels for Nissan approval, a person familiar with the family said.

Renault wields effective control over the Dutch entity, and has the upper hand in the operational alliance. That is a legacy of its investment in Nissan when the Japanese company was in financial difficulties. Today, Renault owns 43% of Nissan, while Nissan owns just 15% of Renault.

People close to Nissan have said Mr. Ghosn’s ouster is an opportunity to rebalance power with Renault. People close to Renault have said the company would oppose any attempts to fundamentally reshape their partnership.

Started in 1999, and built up in large part by Mr. Ghosn, the alliance helps the companies pool technology, basic components, and research and development, creating global scale that allows them to better compete with giants like Volkswagen, Toyota Motor Corp. and General Motors Co.

Osamu Masuko, chief executive of Mitsubishi, which joined the alliance in 2016, said earlier this week that he planned to discuss with his counterparts from Nissan and Renault the group’s future without Mr. Ghosn.

On a gray, rainy Thursday in Amsterdam, executives started arriving at the alliance’s office building before 8 a.m., in black Renault Talismans with tinted windows. About two dozen reporters—many of them from Japan—gathered at the entrance of the building.

Renault Deputy Chief Executive Thierry Bollore, who has stepped in for Mr. Ghosn, and Mitsubishi’s Mr. Masuko joined the meeting via videoconference, according to people familiar with their schedules. A person close to Renault said the two men and Mr. Saikawa had talked Wednesday to prepare for the meeting.

After the meeting, the three leaders sent their employees a memo, praising the alliance’s achievements and adding: “The Alliance is not national, but global, and requires not a few individuals, but our entire team to deliver.”

Back in Japan, authorities will determine Friday whether to extend Mr. Ghosn’s detention for a further 10 days. Shin Kukimoto, deputy chief Tokyo prosecutor, told reporters Thursday that Mr. Ghosn was answering prosecutors’ questions, speaking in English and working with a translator. He said the sessions with the auto executive were being video-recorded.

Mr. Ghosn is being held in a Tokyo detention center in a small cell with tatami mats, in line with conditions for most detainees in Japan who are being investigated over alleged criminal offenses. He is being served three daily meals, consisting mostly of rice.

In response to a question about whether that treatment was harsh, Mr. Kukimoto said: “We are operating within the existing legal system…I wonder at those who would criticize our country’s system because it is different from their own.”",793
